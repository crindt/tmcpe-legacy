\chapter{Introduction and Background}
\label{sec:intro}

\pagenumbering{arabic}

Caltrans has a significant investment in \ac{TMC} throughout the
state. These operations centers are tasked with maintaining the safety
and efficiency of California's highways by actively managing
disruptions to the system caused by anticipated and unanticipated
events that impact the available capacity and/or the demand to use
individual facilities.  Presently, however, no comprehensive methods
are available to quantify the benefits of existing \ac{TMC}
deployments. This research project developed a web-based \ac{TMCPE}
application that addresses this problem. The system allows \ac{TMC}
managers to evaluate the performance of various bundles of \ac{TMC}
technologies and operational policies by mapping their effects onto
events in the system that can be measured using existing surveillance
systems and daily activity logs. The resulting tool provides managers
with the long needed capabilities to:
\begin{itemize}
\item justify valuable technology, personnel allocations, and
  maintenance costs,
\item identify technologies that aren't meeting their initial promise,
  and
\item identify gaps in current operational strategies that might be
  filled with new technology deployments.
\end{itemize}
The evaluation method used considers delay savings that are
attributable to specific \ac{TMC} actions.  All computations are based
on direct measurement of the system using available sensors and do not
rely on speculative simulation models requiring extensive assumptions.

The system is implemented using a modular software architecture that
can interface with a variety of existing or planned systems used by
Caltrans. The initial deployment focused on delivering a reporting
system accessible from the recently deployed website for the
\ac{CTMLabs}, formerly known as the California \ac{ATMS}
Testbed. Possible future deployments could integrate the core
performance evaluation models with real-time \ac{TMC} management
systems to assist operators with prioritizing response.

% This report details progress made to date in this project.
% Chapter~\ref{sec:background} describes the general \ac{TMC} performance
% evaluation problem along with a review of related research and
% recommendations from the literature. 


%\chapter{Background}
%\label{sec:background}

\section{Performance measures of highway systems}
\label{sec:perf-hw-sys}

Recent years have seen a significant push toward better evaluation of
highway systems using data-driven performance measures. A number of
recent federally-sponsored reports offer comprehensive overviews of
current performance monitoring approaches and recommended practice for
transportation management agencies. A common theme of developing an
effective performance measurement system for operations is an early
and complete definition of the goals of the traffic management
system. These goals structure specific efforts in defining performance
measurement tasks and applying the results to improve operations. Once
system goals are defined, they must be translated into metrics that
are obtainable from available (or feasible) data collection systems.
Finally, the metrics should be integrated into management and
operations to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of the system
and, ideally, use that feedback across various time-scales to improve
performance over time. In the next section, we discuss how to apply
this general method to the analysis of \ac{TMC} performance.

\section{Benefits of the TMC}
\label{sec:tmc-bene}

Traffic management centers perform a range of functions to meet broad
transportation management goals. We use the taxonomy offered by Park
(2005) to characterize \ac{TMC} functions into three general areas: traffic
monitoring, travel information, and event management.

\subsection{Traffic monitoring}
\label{sec:traf-mon}

Traffic monitoring includes functions where transportation systems
must be monitored in real-time, such as traffic flow monitoring and
evaluating traffic conditions. To date, Caltrans has made significant
progress in traffic monitoring. Data from the state's sensor network
is available within and across districts---notably through the
\acf{PeMS} \citep{choe02:_freew_perfor_measur_system_pems}, which
offers system-wide measures of effectiveness on traffic flow as well
as the health of the sensor system itself.

\subsection{Travel information}
\label{sec:trav-info}

Travel information programs refer to programs available to the public
that provide information on current traveling conditions. In
California, a number of systems disseminate travel information to the
traveling public through various public channels (traditional media,
511 systems, changeable message signs, traffic web sites, etc.) so
that they can make more informed travel decisions.

Metrics on the benefits of this information dissemination are
generally not available except in vary broad terms from the results of
travel behavior surveys in response to information. Understanding more
clearly how travelers respond to specific information provided by the
\ac{TMC} could identify critical contributions of \ac{TMC} operations that
heretofore are undervalued.

\subsection{Event management}
\label{sec:event-man}

Events managed by the \ac{TMC} may be
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item random (e.g., incidents),
\item recurring (e.g., congestion from prevailing traffic patterns)
  and
\item scheduled (maintenance or special events).
\end{inparaenum}
Generally, such events can impact the normal operating capacity of the
system or can produce demands that are significantly distorted from
the recurrent patterns for which system capacity and control has been
optimized.  Event management---particularly of non-recurrent
congestion caused by incidents---is likely the most tangible benefit
offered by the \ac{TMC}. Procedures vary across districts and are
tuned to the specific capabilities of each, but urban districts with
\acp{TMC} have specialists who actively manage disruptions to the
system. Nonetheless, event management is an area of continued
development for Caltrans.

The typical metric for evaluating \ac{TMC} event management processes is
delay savings. A number of methods have been proposed to estimate
total non-recurrent congestion delay.  They can be classified into
three groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item analytical methods using deterministic queuing diagrams
  \protect\citep[e.g.,]{goolsby71:_influen_of_incid_freew_qualit_of_servic,chow74:_study_of_traff_perfor_model,morales87:_analy_proced_for_estim_freew_traff_conges,trb94:_highw_capac_manual,lawson97:_using_input_output_diagr_to,erera98:_simpl_gener_method_for_analy,skabardonis04:_devel_and_applic_of_method}
\item kinematic wave (i.e., shockwave) theory \citep[e.g.,]{chow74:_study_of_traff_perfor_model,wirasinghe78:_deter_of_traff_delay_from,heydecker94:_incid_and_inter_freew,al-deek95:_new_method_for_estim_freew_incid_conges}
\item heuristic methods \citep[e.g.,]{skabardonis96:_i_field_exper,skabardonis03:_measur_recur_and_nonrec_traff_conges}
\end{enumerate}
The results from these approaches have been applied both alone and in concert
with each other. But, since virtually none of these studies uses a source of
incident data with descriptive variables and reporting techniques in common with
the others, comparisons between different methods are difficult
\citep{goolsby71:_influen_of_incid_freew_qualit_of_servic}, and their spatial
transferability is limited. To date there has been only limited research into
models that can estimate how long, how far, and to what extent any particular
incident will affect traffic and, by extension, little research into
understanding how \acp{TMC} perform at minimizing the impact of such incidents.
The focus in this project has been the development of incident-specific
delay-estimation metrics that can be used to evaluate \ac{TMC} performance.
% The next section
% details the methods developed to date and suggests an approach for
% applying these delay metrics to analyzing the impacts of \ac{TMC} processes
% on incident-related delay.


\section{Data sources}
\label{sec:data-sources}

Performance evaluation requires data.  Specifically, data is needed
about what is happening in the freeway system and data is needed about
actions taken by the \ac{TMC} and other agencies.  In its role as an
information broker for Caltrans, the \ac{TMC} has access to a range of
information that can meet these needs in whole or part.  We summarize
them in the below as they dictate the types of performance evaluation
analyses that are possible

\subsection{System data}
\label{sec:system-data}

The real-time traffic data collected by Caltrans loop detectors
stations are the primary source of information regarding the actual
performance of the freeway system during incidents. A number of
sources supply this data in a manner that can be used for this
project.  It should be noted, however, that a local archive of the
data must be maintained as the delay calculations rely on customized
queries for relevant sensor data.  These queries are not generally
available from the systems listed below.

\subsubsection{PeMS}
\label{sec:pems}

The Caltrans \acl{PeMS} has become the \emph{de facto} standard for
processed freeway sensor data in the state of California.  The
original work that served as the basis for the core of the \ac{TMCPE}
system developed in this research
\citep{recker05:_tool_for_incor_of_non} used the \ac{PeMS} database to
obtain a year of 5-minute data from every sensor in Orange County.
This data was archived in a local database to support the prototyping
of efficient database queries necessary for the analysis.  \ac{PeMS}
offers access to this data archive that is scriptable and therefore
could be incorporated as the primary data source for archived
performance in the system for the current effort.

\subsubsection{The CTMLabs sensor archive}
\label{sec:uci-data}


The \ac{CTMLabs} provide an ideal implementation platform for
accessing detector data because the \ac{CTMLabs} receive identical
data to that available in the \ac{TMC} by way of the \ac{CTMLabs}
real-time data intertie and the associated database.  As such,
development can proceed in the \ac{CTMLabs} and later be transferred
seamlessly to operation in District 12.

\subsubsection{Caltrans District 12 XML/SOAP interface}
\label{sec:d12-soap}

For greater transferability, the \ac{TMCPE} system can also make use
of the \emph{devices} implementation in the District 12's SOAP
interface.  This interface implements portions of the center-to-center
interface of the National ITS Architecture standard---including the
\ac{VDS} interface standard which streams 30-second sensor readings from
all detectors in the district.  In order to make use of this
interface, the \ac{TMCPE} system would need to build its own archive
of sensor data received.  Since this is already being done as part of
the \ac{CTMLabs} sensor archive, reproducing this effort to support
the \ac{TMCPE} application is not necessary.

\subsection{TMC actions}
\label{sec:tmc-actions}

The actions of the \ac{TMC} and other event response personnel are
recorded and available from several sources as outlined below.

\subsubsection{CHP iCAD log (XML feed)}
\label{sec:chp-icad-log}

The \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} system logs all roadway incident reports
including: incident date, \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} identification number
(ID), \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} time stamp, incident type, and incident
location. This data is not presented in a canonical format and
therefore is not necessarily easy to parse automatically.  Nonetheless,
it is the only source for raw information regarding multi-agency
incident response.

The functions provided by the \ac{TMCPE} project require a local copy
of the key data from the \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} log---particularly the
geographic location of incidents.  If the geographic data is added to
the Activity Log (see section~\ref{sec:tmc-activity-log} below), the
direct dependence of the \ac{TMCPE} system on the \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD}
log can be removed.

\subsubsection{District 12 SOAP interface (events, devices)}
\label{sec:d12-soap-interface}

The District 12 SOAP interface also streams event data from the \ac{TMC} and
control states of \acp{CMS} and \acp{RMS}.  The event data could be
tapped to obtain incident verification details, while the \ac{CMS} and
\ac{RMS} settings could be parsed to infer control actions carried out
by operators.  Ideally, however, any control actions would be tied to
specific \ac{TMC} processes and their associated goals (see section 6
for further discussion on relating actions to \ac{TMC} processes).

\subsubsection{TMC activity log}
\label{sec:tmc-activity-log}

The District 12 \ac{TMC} activity log records a range of actions carried
out by \ac{TMC} operators that they manually record using a web-based
interface to the log database.  Transactions in the database are cross
referenced with \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} IDs, which allows additional data
from the \ac{iCAD} system---such as the incident's geographic
coordinates---to be associated with each incident under analysis.  At
the beginning of this project, only a limited number of database
entries were reliable enough to be parsed automatically and thus be
used directly by the \ac{TMCPE} system.  These were the
\texttt{OPEN/CLOSE INCIDENT} and \texttt{SIGALERT BEGIN/END} entries.
Additional entries relating to the status of changeable message signs
and construction closures were useful for cross checking, but
generally were not able to be used in the calculations described in
chapter~\ref{sec:method} in their present form.  Nonetheless, the
activity log's comprehensive nature and integration into \ac{TMC}
processes in District 12 made it the natural choice for obtaining
information about incident management in the \ac{TMC}.


\subsubsection{TMCAL}
\label{sec:tmcal}

During the course of this project, Caltrans began work on developing
the \ac{TMCAL} system to provide a common, statewide standard for
recording information about managed incidents in the state of
California.  The users and developers of the District 12 activity log
have participated in the specification of \ac{TMCAL} to ensure that
the functionality of the District 12 \ac{TMC} activity log is
replicated in TMCAL.  As such, we proceeded to develop of the
\ac{TMCPE} system using the District 12 \ac{TMC} activity log as the
reference data source under the assumption that a later shift to the
\ac{TMCAL} system would be straightforward given their common
ancestry.

\section{Organization of this report}
\label{sec:organization}


The remainder of this report is structured as follows.
Chapter~\ref{chap:tmc-activity} describes the processes used in the Caltrans
District 12 \ac{TMC} during the management of accidents, which is the initial
target of this performance evaluation effort.  Chapter~\ref{sec:method} details
the methods being used for performance measurement---with a focus on the
calculation of delay attributable to specific incidents as well as a discussion
of how to model the impacts of \ac{TMC} actions on the dynamics of such
incidents.
%Section \ref{} offers a preliminary
%analysis of three representative incidents used to evaluate the
%method. 
Chapter~\ref{sec:system-architecture} describes the system architecture that was
developed to deploy the system as an operational tool for the \ac{TMC} as part
of the \ac{CTMLabs}.  In chapter~\ref{chap:results}, we discuss representative
results from the system and we conclude in chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} with
some recommendations for continued development of the \ac{TMCPE} system.
%Finally, section \ref{} offers some recommendations for
%modifications to existing processes and tools in the District 12 \ac{TMC}
%(particularly the \ac{TMC} activity log) that will support more complete
%performance evaluation metrics going forward.

\chapter{TMC Activity}
\label{chap:tmc-activity}

At the onset of this project, the District 12 \ac{TMC} employed
locally-developed \ac{TMC} activity log software
(section~\ref{sec:tmc-activity-log}) to record traffic management
activity carried out by the \ac{TMC}.  This software was developed
over a number of years with a variety of purposes in mind.  Though the
initial analyses have been conducted using this existing logging data,
the data is unsuitable for general purpose automated processing to
identify critical events in \ac{TMC} operations that impact system
performance.  As such, work was initiated under this contract to
improve the activity logging system to better meet such performance
monitoring needs going forward.

A critical first step in this process was the identification of core events in
incident management that can be directly recorded by the activity logging system
through a set of interviews and communications with District 12 staff and
contractors.  The following summarizes the \ac{TMC} processes used to manage
accidents occurring in the managed system.  Note that this effort was carried
out in parallel to a number of efforts in District 12 and beyond to capture and
organize event management, including District 12's event management system
development and the Caltrans-wide effort to develop the \ac{TMCAL} system.  Any
findings below should be considered one characterization of the larger problem
of organizing \ac{TMC} processes to best manage, monitor, and evaluate Caltrans
traffic management in general, and \ac{TMC} activity in particular.

Based upon our interviews, incident management by the \ac{TMC} can be described
as four major subprocesses that are traversed sequentially as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}
\begin{sidewaysfigure}
  \pgfpagesuselayout{resize to}[letterpaper,landscape,border shrink=5mm]
  \centering
  \input{figs/process-flowchart-2.tikz}
  \caption[TMC process flowchart for accident management]{TMC process
    flowchart for accident management.  Four major subprocesses
    dictate a series of actions to be carried out by the TMC.  The
    trajectory through the subprocesses is governed by a series of
    events whose dynamics are dictated by events in the field.}
  \label{fig:flowchart}
\end{sidewaysfigure}
Each subprocess dictates a series of actions to be carried out by the \ac{TMC}.
The transition between the subprocesses is governed by a series of events whose
dynamics are dictated by events in the field.

\section{Identification}
\label{sec:identification}


\ac{TMC} management of an incident always begins with the {\sc First Call} to
the \ac{TMC}, which notifies operators that there has been a disruption to what
is considered ``normal'' operating conditions.  From an operational perspective,
these disruptions can affect the capacity of particular sections of roadway (as
in a traffic accident), the prevailing demand to use particular stretches of
roadway (as in a special event), or some combination of the two.  Our emphasis
for the current discussion is capacity-reducing accidents.

The {\sc First Call} can come from any number of sources including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD}
\item \acf{ATMS} software map
\item Caltrans field units
\item Public---via phone
\item CCTV
\item Media
\item Neighboring districts
\end{itemize}
The vast majority come by way of the \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} system and the local
\ac{CHP} liaison to the \ac{TMC}.

When a {\sc First Call} is received, initial details are collected about the
location, type, and likely impact on the system.  \ac{TMC} staff is notified and
a decision is made to manage the incident, which we term an {\sc Open Incident}
event, at which point the process transitions to the Verification stage.


\section{Verification}
\label{sec:verification}

The purpose of verification is to identify and confirm the details of the
incident to support response including the location, type, severity, and any
other special conditions that are necessary to support \ac{TMC} operations.
Strictly speaking, the \ac{TMC} cannot respond to the incident until its
characteristics are known.  This is particularly true in situations requiring
special response, such as incidents requiring hazardous material spills.  Since
total queuing delay is proportional to the fourth power of the response time
(see section~\ref{sec:total-delay}), the speed with which verification is
carried out can be a significant determinant to the quality of the response and
the subsequent degree of disruption experienced by users of the system.

The \ac{TMC} has a number of resources to support verification including:
\begin{itemize}
\item CCTV (both those owned by Caltrans and those owned by partner
  agencies)
\item \ac{CHP} field units
\item Caltrans field units
\end{itemize}
\ac{TMC} operators use information collected via resources to characterize the
incident---which we term a diagnosis---for the purpose of formulating a
response.  Once a diagnosis is produced, verification is complete and the
\ac{TMC} moves to the {\sc Response} subprocess.

\section{Response}
\label{sec:response}

The response subprocess is understandably the most involved activity carried out
by the \ac{TMC}.  The collection of activities carried fall into four
categories: Information dissemination, Field Response, Coordination, and
Control.

\subsection{Information dissemination}
\label{sec:inf-dis}

The sharing of information regarding the incident is one of the most critical
actions carried out by the \ac{TMC}.  Information must flow to a number of
audiences.  Among the most important recipients are the operators and management
of other agencies---including neighboring Caltrans districts and management,
whose actions may depend on or involve the affected facilities.  Dedicated
procedures exist for providing this communication, and for specifying when such
communication must occur.  For instance, headquarters is always notified when a
SIGALERT is issued, updated, and terminated.

Similarly, the users of the system must be notified of disruptions.  This serves
the purpose of providing both higher quality of service to users, since lack of
information degrades the user experience, as well as acting as a control
mechanism to initiate unmanaged diversion (see below for prescribed diversion).
A number of communications channels exist for notifying the public.  The media
is informed through various information feeds that are provided directly or
indirectly by Caltrans and its partner agencies.  For instance, members of the
media can access the public \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} feed as well as speed information
derived from Caltrans freeway sensors and exposed to various traffic information
providers by via the \ac{ATMS} software system.  Issuance of a SIGALERT (by the
\ac{CHP}) or a Traffic Advisory (by Caltrans) triggers specific interactions
with the media.  Information can be provided directly to users in the vicinity
of the incident using the fixed or mobile \acf{CMS} and \ac{HAR} systems.

\subsection{Field response}
\label{sec:field-response}

The field response to a particular incident is governed by the diagnosis
generated during the {\sc Verification} process.  The Caltrans \ac{TMC} is
responsible for managing the actions of \acfp{TMT}, \ac{HAZMAT} crews,
maintenance crews, and the coroner (managed by the \ac{CHP}) that are dispatched
to mitigate the impacts of an incident on traffic operations and system
infrastructure.  These actions are critical to restoring the performance of the
system to normal and are therefore time critical events that must be logged
effectively to support performance evaluation.

\subsection{Coordinate}
\label{sec:coordinate}

Though the transportation system is divided into multiple jurisdictions for
management purposes, its global performance is linked by the actions of other
agencies, most notably the \ac{CHP}, neighboring Caltrans districts, and
neighboring municipalities.  From interviews with \ac{TMC} staff, coordination
with \ac{CHP} is fluid, with the \ac{CHP} and the \ac{TMC} working in concert to
manage incidents.  Coordination with neighboring districts also involves fluid
communications regarding actions and responsibilities.  Coordination with
municipal entities is limited except in the case of severe incidents.  In those
instances, response coordination is typically governed by pre-defined
coordinated response plans that govern actions, for instance, in the case of a
freeway closure and subsequent diversion to a municipality's surface street
network.


\subsection{Control}
\label{sec:control}

Active traffic control actions taken by Caltrans are typically limited to the
most severe incidents.  In those cases, Caltrans may institute a freeway closure
and prescribed diversion.  In very rare instances involving long-term closures,
settings of field traffic controllers (such as time-of-day ramp metering
settings) may be modified to account for shifts in prevailing traffic flow.


\section{Monitoring}
\label{sec:monitoring}

Each discrete response activity described above has an explicit or implicit
intended outcome that would, in an ideal system, be directly measurable via the
monitoring subprocess.  In reality, the impact of only a subset of the response
actions can be measured directly.  For instance, the efforts of \ac{CHP},
\acp{TMT}, etc. to clear the roadway can be recorded directly in the \ac{TMC}
activity logs as lanes restored.  The impact of information dissemination, on
the other hand, is very difficult to infer from the course sensor data
available.  The monitoring process should also track when additional event(s)
occur that may impact the mitigation efforts for a prevailing incident.
Management of multiple incidents may be handled separately or combined into a
single management problem.

Generally, the monitoring process should keep track of changes to the system as
they relate to the incident in question.  Changes might include arrival of
\ac{TMT}s or other response crews, lane clearance, completion of \ac{HAZMAT}
efforts, length of queuing (for validation purposes) and any other information
that is potentially relevant to incident post analysis.  Each such (verified)
{\sc Status Change} could produce an updated diagnosis and possibly changes to
the \ac{TMC} response, as indicated by the feedback loop in
figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}.


\section{Practical Concerns}
\label{sec:practical-concerns}

The \ac{TMC} is a complex environment with a vast array of hardware and software
collecting, managing, and disseminating information regarding the performance
and operation of the Caltrans highway network.  It is notable that a number of
these systems have functions that occasionally overlap.  For instance, the
activity logging software is the \emph{de facto} interface for \ac{TMC}
operators in District 12 engaged in traffic management.  However, a subset of
\ac{TMC} actions, like setting the \ac{CMS} messages are carried out via the
\ac{ATMS} software system.  Logging of \ac{CMS} messages in the activity log
must (currently) be done manually.  Furthermore, Caltrans continues to actively
develop an expert system for event management to improve event management
processes by formalizing them and mandating that certain information is recorded
and that particular actions are carried out.

In this complex environment, additional logging burdens are not likely to be
well received.  Ideally, many \ac{TMC} actions would be automatically logged
using messages passed between the various software systems (including the
\ac{TMC} activity log interface) to a logging service that maintains the backend
logging database.  With this in mind, we recommend a simple, extensible event
tagging system that captures key points of the incident management process
consistent with the above description.  These event tags correspond to the red
events in figure~\ref{fig:flowchart} and are summarized in
table~\ref{tab:tmc-event-summary}.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
 \footnotesize
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
  \hline
  \textbf{Event tag} & \textbf{Description}\\
  \hline {\sc \textcolor{red}{First Call}} & Logged when a \ac{TMC}
  operator received the first report of an incident.  Typically will
  be the first entry in the activity log with an associated \ac{CHP}
  \ac{iCAD} ID
  and should note the source of the notification.  \\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Open Incident}} & Logged when the decision is
  made that a particular incident must be tracked and
  managed by the \ac{TMC}.\\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Verify Incident}} & Logged when the details of
  the incident have been confirmed.  Should include all sources (and
  technology) used to verify the characteristics of the incident.  \\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Response Action:<Subtype>}} & Logged when a
  particular action is taken to mitigate the impact of an incident.
  The range of actions available for logging will vary with the
  situation.\\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Status Change:<Subtype>}} & Logged when a
  notable change to the managed event has occurred.  For instance,
  arrival of \ac{TMT}, restoration of a lane, etc.  Informational
  messages for model validation are useful here too, such as noting
  the
  location of the back of the queue.\\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Close Incident}} & Logged when all management
  functions have terminated and traffic flow has returned to normal
  conditions. \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
  \caption{Core TMC events to be recorded by the activity log to support TMC performance evaluation}
  \label{tab:tmc-event-summary}
\end{table}

The {\sc Response Action} and {\sc Status Change} tags will ideally include a
complete set of possible response/condition pairs that characterizes \ac{TMC}
actions and their effects.  To the extent that the \ac{TMC} Logging system can
standardize logging to produce unambiguous tags for these events, the
performance evaluation system will be able to reconstruct historical incidents
for post-analysis.  The next chapter describes that modeling methodology used in
the \ac{TMCPE} system.

\chapter{Modeling Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

To determine the relative impact of \ac{TMC} technologies and processes on the
performance of the system, we decompose the analysis into two general steps.  In
the first step, an \emph{incident impact model}
(section~\ref{sec:incident-impact-model}) estimates the degree to which an
incident disrupts freeway operations in time and space (the ``control volume'')
as well as the total delay in the control volume using sensor observations
relative to ``average'' conditions.  This delay estimate serves as a baseline
condition for the analysis.  In the second phase of the analysis, we use the
\emph{\ac{TMC} impact model} (section~\ref{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}) to explore how
system performance would change in the absence of specific \ac{TMC} actions by
coupling observations and estimated changes in critical incident parameters with
a model based upon queuing theory to estimate delays for the same incident if
the \ac{TMC} was absent.


\section{Incident impact model}
\label{sec:incident-impact-model}

\subsection{Section definition}
\label{sec:sec-def}
A freeway section in this study corresponds to a mainline loop detector
station. Section boundaries are defined by the middle of two detector stations
as shown in figure~\ref{fig:sec-def}.  We assume that estimated speed at the
station is representative of the speed for the corresponding section.  Based on
the sections and their corresponding detector stations, estimated speeds and
densities for each section i are calculated for each 5-minute interval during
the one-year analysis period---sections downstream of section i are labeled
consecutively as $(i + 1), (i + 2), \ldots{}$ while those upstream are labeled
consecutively as $(i - 1), (i - 2), \ldots{}$.
\begin{figure}[t]%
  \begin{center}%
    \inputTikZ{figs/standard-freeway-sectioning}%
    \caption[Section definition and corresponding detector
    location]{Section definition and corresponding detector location.
      Sections boundaries are formed by bisecting freeway segments between
      each pair of detectors.  By convention, section numbers increase as
      you move downstream. }
    \label{fig:sec-def}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Stream state estimation using single loops}
\label{sec:state-est}

This method relies upon access to the prior one-year of historical traffic
data---specifically: traffic counts and occupancy for each lane at each detector
station every 30 seconds. Lane-by-lane traffic data is aggregated to 5-minute
intervals at each detector station in order to obtain stable traffic data from
each point.

Loop detectors in Orange County predominantly are single loop detectors that
provide only traffic counts and occupancies; travel speeds need to be estimated
from these measures assuming a so-called ``$g$-factor,'' the summation of the
average vehicle length and effective detection length
\citep{hall89:_evaluat_of_speed_estim_made,jia01:_pems_algor_for_accur_real,wang03:_can_singl_loop_detec_do}.
The average speed, $\overline{s}$ , can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:speed-est}
  \overline{s} (\unitfrac{mi}{h}) = g\left(\frac{q}{5280(\unitfrac{ft}{mi}) \times occ}\right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[$q$] = $\textrm{flow rate} (\unitfrac{veh}{h})$
\item[$occ$] = $\textrm{vehicle occupancy} (\%)$
\item[$g$]= $\textrm{$g$-factor}$ 
\end{description}
\end{quote}
Applying appropriate $g$-factors is a key in estimating speeds from
single loop detector data. There are various ways to estimate
$g$-factors.  The simplest approach is to use a single $g$-factor for
all loop detectors in the study area.  Although this is very common in
practice, the approximation from this approach is too coarse for the
objective of this study.  An alternative is to use a single $g$-factor
for each lane through the entire freeway system.  This approach
accounts for vehicle length varying by lane, but assumes the same
proportion of heavy vehicles on every section of the freeway.  Another
approach is to find a single $g$-factor for every loop in each lane.
This can be estimated by using flow and occupancy from some period for
which speed can be assumed to be known; for example, flow and
occupancy during 1:00AM-1:05AM, where the average speed can be assumed
as a free flow speed, can be used to calculate the $g$-factor.  This
approach, however, does not account for the variation of the vehicle
composition over time.  \citet{jia01:_pems_algor_for_accur_real} noted
that the $g$-factors for different loop detectors in the same district
differ by as much as 100 percent, and the $g$-factors for the same
loop can vary up to 50 percent over 24-hour period.

In this research, we account for spatial and temporal variations of
the $g$-factors by calculating a $g$-factor representing each hour
interval over the 52 weeks for each loop detector station as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:g-fact}
  \hat{g}_i(t+1) = p\cdot{}\hat{g}_i(t)+(1-p)\cdot{}g_i(t+1)
\end{equation}
\begin{quote}
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\hat{g}_i(t)$] = $g$-factor for section $i$ for time step $t$
  \item[$g_i(t+1)$] = initial average $g$-factor for section $i$ for
    time step $t+1$, obtained by assuming free-flow speed (75-mph)
    when the occupancy is lower than 0.06
  \item[$p$] = smoothing parameter (0.9 in this research)
  \end{description}
\end{quote}
By applying the above procedure, representative $g$-factors for each hour of day
are calculated for all loop detector stations. These $g$-factors provide basic
information for speed calculation in this study. Based on these $g$-factors,
speeds are calculated every 5 minutes for all 52 weeks.

\subsection{Nominal speed distribution}
\label{sec:nom-speed-dist}
For each freeway section j , for each specific 5-minute time interval
$t_m$ on each day of the week, a nominal total of 52 observations are
available during the one-year observation period on which to base
calculations of flow $q_j(t_m)$ and occupancy $\mathrm{occ}_j(t_m)$
under conditions that are incident free. For example, section $j$ on
Monday from $t_m$ = 08:10 to 08:15 for 52 weeks is composed of 52
samples. Thus the speed associated with the $n$\textsuperscript{th}
observation for any particular day-of-week/time interval/section
combination can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nominal-speed-obs}
  \overline{s}_{jn}(t_m) = g_{jn}(t_m)\left(\frac{q_{jn}(t_m)}{5280\times occ_{jn}(t_m)}\right);n=1,2,\ldots,K,\ldots{52}
\end{equation}
where the subscript n is used to designate the estimate of the
corresponding value based on the $n$\textsuperscript{th}
observation. From these (nominally) 52 observations, a distribution of
$s_{jn}(t_m)$ can be constructed, such as that shown in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-case}.  Then, let $\Omega_{jm} =
\Omega\left(\overline{s}_j(t_m),\sigma_{s_j}(t_m)\right)$ denote the
set of parameters defining the distribution of speeds $s_{jn}(t_m)$
corresponding to this ``incident-free'' base case. (Here, we make no
attempt to categorize these distributions among the set of well-known
distributions, but rather assume, for simplicity, that they can be
adequately defined by their means and standard deviations.)  Then,
associated with an incident known to have occurred on freeway section
$i$ during some time interval $t_1$ , we can compose a matrix of the
parameters defining the distribution of base case conditions (i.e.,
conditions in which there is no incident) that can be expected to
prevail for $t_m \ge t_1, m = 1, 2, \ldots{}, M$ (i.e., time intervals
after the incident that occurs in section i at t1 ) for all upstream
sections that could possibly have been affected by the incident, as in
figure~\ref{tab:speed-base-case-dist}.

Similarly, associated with a known incident that occurs on freeway section $i$
at time $t = t1$, we can construct a matrix of speeds $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ based on
observed loop data under the incident conditions, $ \hat{q}_j(t_m),
\hat{k}_j(t_m); j=i,i-1,i-2,\ldots{},1 ; m = 1,2,\ldots{},M$ as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:shat}
  \hat{s}_j(t_m) = \frac{\hat{q}_j(t_m)}{\hat{k}_j(t_m)}; \: j=i,i-1,i-2,\ldots{},1 ;
m = 1,2,\ldots{},M
\end{equation}
from which we can then compose a matrix of incident case speed conditions (i.e.,
conditions that were observed to prevail following the incident) as in
figure~\ref{tab:speed-obs-dist}.

Using figure~\ref{tab:speed-obs-dist}, we can identify the
negative effects (i.e., speed reduction) of the incident schematically
as shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact}.  The negative effect by
the incident will be propagated from the incident section to upstream
sections.  Such a distinct discontinuity between non-congested and
congested flow is known as a shock wave
\citep{lighthill55:_kinem_waves}.  If the dot-shaded (yellow) area
affected by the shock wave in figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact} is
identified, then the temporal and spatial impacts of the incident will
be also determined. 
\begin{figure}[tbp]

    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic}
    \caption[Incident impact projected into discrete space]{Incident

      is described in terms of discrete spatial ($i$) and temporal ($t$)
      sections as shown.  An incident occurring at the downstream end of
      section $i$ at time $t_1$ disrupts flow for some period of time.
      The geometry of the fastest possible shockwave line dictates that
      the sections above cannot be impacted by the incident (shown in
      gray).  The sections below this line (shown in blue) could
      feasibly be impacted by the incident.  In actuality, only a subset
      of the discrete sections (shown in yellow) will be circumscribed
      by the loading and clearing shockwaves.}
    \label{fig:incident-impact}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
We approach this identification as a topology problem in which the
objective is to construct the most probable set of cells that define
the incident-affected temporal/spatial region, subject to constraints
imposed by allowable shapes of the affected region. The following
section describes the method for discriminating the regions between
non-congested and congested area due to traffic incidents.


\subsection{Quantifying the total delay caused by an incident}
\label{sec:delay-calc}

\subsubsection{Determining maximum extent of incident influence}
\label{sec:max-infl}

Since data on neither the severity (such as the number of closed lanes
by an incident) nor when the incident was cleared are directly
obtainable from loop data, we first estimate the maximum possible
extent of the shock wave by assuming the worst possible
conditions---total blockage for some pre-specified time period. Thus,
for any given incident occurring at section i at time $t_1$ , we
compute the maximum number of upstream sections that could be affected
by the assumed persistent total blockage at section i at time $t_1$
. Using this sort of data, we can schematically construct the
``maximum area of interest'' for any incident occurring at section $i$
at time $t_1$ as the shaded (blue) area in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact}. Based on this interpretation, the
only data relevant to the current example of an incident occurring at
section $i$ at time $t_1$ can be restricted to cells in the shaded
(blue) area. That is, the region of interest can be depicted as shown
in figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact-feas}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic-reduced}
    \caption[Reduced feasible space]{Reduced feasible space.}
    \label{fig:incident-impact-feas}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Determining the congested region}
\label{sec:det-cong-reg}

Figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact-feas} shows two shaded areas: a
dot-shaded (yellow) area and plain-shaded (blue) area. The cells in
the dot-shaded (yellow) area represent speeds, $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$, that
have been determined to have been affected by the incident; i.e., they
have been deemed to be significantly lower than would be expected
based on the distribution of non-incident base speeds for that
particular section-time interval combination.  The plain-shaded (blue)
cells represent particular section-time interval combinations for
which the observed speeds are not significantly different from
non-incident conditions.  That is, they are speeds that are determined
from observation not to be affected by the pertinent incident, but
within the maximum possible affected  sections by an
incident of greatest consequence (when all lanes are blocked, as
assumed above).

Considering that the speed of traffic in sections adversely affected
by the traffic incident will be lowered, the basic idea behind
discriminating between these two regions is to compare the incident
speed, $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$, to the distribution of the non-incident
speeds $s_{jn}(t_m); n = 1,2,\ldots{},n_{obs}; n_{obs}\le 52$ and
assign some level of confidence that any particular $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$
was not drawn from the distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$. If we limit our
level of confidence that the speed was not drawn from the distribution
of $s_{jn}(t_m)$ to those that compute to be at least
$\alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$ , where $\alpha$ is a positive number,
below the mean speed of the distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$, we can
define two cases according to the difference between the mean speed
and the threshold as shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-case}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/incident-speed-classification}
    \caption[The method for determining whether observed speeds are
    evidence of abnormal conditions.]{The method for determining whether
      observed speeds are evidence of abnormal conditions.  An observed
      speed distribution for a given freeway section $j$ and time of day
      $m$ is shown (in blue) having a mean $\overline{s}_j(t_m)$ and
      standard deviation $\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$.  When the observed speed
      estimate $\hat{s}_j(m)$ of a section falls below the critical
      threshold $\hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) -
      \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$, the observation is treated as
      evidence that an incident is occurring.  When $\hat{s}_j(t_m) >
      \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$, the
      observation is treated as evidence of normal conditions.}
    \label{fig:incident-speed-case}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
If, in the representation of figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact-feas}, we
assign to the cells in which speed has been significantly affected by
the incident the outcome of the probability that the speed
$\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ in such cells is drawn from the distribution of speeds
associated with non-incident conditions, we can construct the binary
matrix shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary},
as the ``true'' representation of the affected region.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic-binary}
    \caption[Binary incident speed classification matrix]{Binary incident speed classification matrix.}
    \label{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

However, owing to uncertainties and other externalities, assigning an
outcome based on a significance test related to the null hypothesis
that the cell speed actually came from the non-incident speed
distribution, in general will result in less-than accurate conclusions
regarding the affected region, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary-dirty}, where the
true boundary of the affected region is shown by the red line.

If we define $P_{jm}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pjm}
  P_{jm} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)},\\
    1;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) > \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
the problem of determining the ``best'' set of ``dot-shaded (or yellow)'' cells can be
formulated as following statement.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:best-as-minimum}
  \sum\limits_{\forall\text{dot shaded cells}} P_{jm} + \sum\limits_{\forall\text{unshaded cells}} (1-P_{jm}) = \text{Minimum}
\end{equation}
Or, defining
\begin{equation*}
  \delta_{jm} =
  \begin{cases}
    1,& \text{if cell is affected by the incident (i.e., dot-shaded)},\\
    0,& \text{if cell is not affected by the incident (i.e., plain shaded)}.
  \end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
Equation~(\ref{eq:best-as-minimum}) can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:best-as-minimum-w-delta}
  \sum\limits_{\forall j,m}\left[P_{jm}\cdot\delta_{jm}+(1-P_{jm})\cdot(1-\delta_{jm})\right] = \text{Minimum}
\end{equation}
In this minimization problem, care must be taken regarding the number
of observations because we use statistics regarding the mean and
standard deviation that would be sensitive to the number of
observations. It must be noted that a relatively high portion of
traffic data cannot be collected due to various reasons, e.g.,
electrical malfunction of detector and temporary freeway maintenance
work. However, when calculating the mean and standard deviation of the
distribution of the non-accident speeds $s_{jn}(t_m); n = 1,
2,\ldots{}, n_{\mathrm{obs}}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \le 52$ and assigning
some level of confidence that any particular $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ was not
drawn from the distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$ , we need a ``sufficient
number'' of observations, $n_{\mathrm{obs}}$.  We first need to set a
threshold regarding the minimum number of observations that we require
in order to have some confidence in the statistical calculations for
mean and standard deviation, say $n_{\textrm{minobs}}$. Since 30 is
commonly used for the minimum number of observations required for the
law of large numbers to apply, we set $n_{\textrm{minobs}} =
30$. Then, for cells in the matrix in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary} for which
$n_{\mathrm{obs}} < n_{\textrm{minobs}}$, we set $P_{jm} = 0.5$ and
continue the analysis; i.e., we modify the definition of $P_{jm}$ as
follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pjm-final}
  P_{jm} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \ge n_{\textrm{minobs}}\\
    1;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) > \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \ge n_{\textrm{minobs}}\\
    0.5;& n_{\mathrm{obs}} < n_{\textrm{minobs}}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Moreover, the subset of cells for which the accident speeds are
significantly different from the non-accident speeds comprise a region
that theoretically must obey certain properties. Specifically, there
are three impossible local shape configurations for the subset of
spatio-temporal cells congested by the accident. The first such case
is a region that contains any holes, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-1}.
\begin{figure}[t]

    \label{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
In addition, the vertical position ($t$) of any dot-shaded
(``yellow'') section $j$ must be either lower or same (i.e., $\le$ )
vertical position of the neighboring shaded (``yellow'') section $j -
n$ , as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-2}.
\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption[Impossible shape II of the impacted region]{Impossible shape II of the impacted region.}

\end{figure}
Likewise, figure~\ref{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-3}
represents another impermissible configuration.

\end{figure}
These conditions can be enforced by the following relationships:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:constraint-relationships}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:constraint-relationship-a}
    \delta_{j+k,m} &\le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le J - j\\
    \label{eq:constraint-relationship-b}        
    \delta_{j,m+r} & \le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j,m+1})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}r \le M - m\\
    \label{eq:constraint-relationship-c}            
    \delta_{j,m+k} & \le \left[1 + (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le M - m
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $R$ is a large number, $J$ is the maximum number of upstream sections, and
$M$ is the maximum number of time period, in 5-minute intervals (e.g., if the
analysis time period is 4 hours in the study, $M$ = 48).
Equations~(\ref{eq:best-as-minimum-w-delta}) and
(\ref{eq:constraint-relationships}) are in the form of the objective function
and constraint, respectively, of \ac{BIP} The determination problem described
above can be represented in the form of the following \ac{BIP} problem:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \label{eq:bip-formulation}
  \min\limits_{\delta_{jm}} Z & = \sum\limits_{\forall{}j,m}\left[P_{jm}\cdot{}\delta_{jm}+(1-P_{jm})(1-\delta_{jm})\right] \\
  \textrm{st}~~~~~~~~~&\\
    \delta_{j+k,m} &\le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le J - j\\
    \delta_{j,m+r} & \le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j,m+1})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}r \le M - m\\
    \delta_{j,m+k} & \le \left[1 + (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le M - m
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
In the definition of $P_{jm}$, the threshold value $\alpha$ is very
critical to separate between speed affected by an incident and the
other speeds.  In this study, various values were applied to find the
best threshold. The best value was empirically found from the relation
between traffic data and traffic accident as $\alpha = 0.25$.

\subsection{Improvements to the core delay model}
\label{sec:delay-improvements}

When research is transferred into application, the idealized
assumptions underlying the model are often found to oversimplify the
real world.  In the case of \ac{TMCPE}, this technology transfer required
some fine tuning of the assumptions in a number of areas, which are
outlined below.

% \subsubsection{Bounding the incident}
% \label{sec:incident-bounds}

% Computing maximum feasible time-space bounds of an incident impact is
% critical both to keeping the calculations for each event tractable.

%%\fixme[]{crindt}{Discuss the use of leading and trailing shockwave constraints}


\subsubsection{Distance weighting}
\label{sec:dist-weight}

One common characteristic of real-world data is that incidents do not
occur in isolation.  Many times these incidents are related, while
other times they are independent.  Furthermore, a randomly sampled
time-space section in the freeway network will often have regions of
congestion arising from the random processes underlying traffic flow.
As such, it is fairly common for such congestion plumes to be
sufficiently close in time and space to a known incident locations.

In such cases, a poorly tuned delay algorithm might erroneously
attribute the random congestion to the known event.  One such case is
shown in figure~\ref{fig:distance-weighting-helpful}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/distance-weighting-helpful.png}
    \caption[A case where distance weighting is helpful]{A case where distance
      weighting is helpful.  In this plot, traffic travels from the top right
      corner to the bottom left.  The incident occurred where the two blue lines
      cross.  The small congestion plume adjacent to the cross is the
      appropriate extent of impact.  However, the algorithm attaches the
      unrelated upstream congestion because the resulting false positives don't
      outweigh the addition of new correct positives.}
    \label{fig:distance-weighting-helpful}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
Here, a known incident causes a congestion plume that is clearly
spatially distinct from some random upstream disturbance.  Nonetheless
the simplified delay calculation model attributes the random
congestion to the known event.  This is because in the mathematical
programming objective, it is ``cheaper'' to incorrectly identify the
uncongested area between the plumes as congested rather than miss out
on the opportunity to identify upstream congestion as related to the
known incident.  This bundling of plumes, however, is an artifact of
how the objective function is defined rather than a correct
attribution of congestion to the given event.  In short, the objective
function as defined fails to produce a result that matches reality.

We considered two approaches to improving the ability of the model to
account for such cases.  The first approach was to bias the objective
function to make false positives more ``costly'' to the algorithm than
false negatives.  More specifically, this altered the objective
function in \eqref{eq:bip-formulation} to be:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:false-positive-bias}
  \min\limits_{\delta_{jm}} Z = \sum\limits_{\forall{}j,m}\left[(1-\beta)\cdot{}P_{jm}\cdot{}\delta_{jm}+(1-P_{jm})(1-\delta_{jm})\right]
\end{equation}
where $\beta \in (0,1)$ is a parameter set to reduce the importance of
false negatives.  As $\beta \rightarrow 1$, the importance of false
negatives is reduced.  For instance, setting $\beta = 0.1$ effectively
makes a false negative 10\% less important than a false positive.
%
This method, however tended to be too conservative and would result in
the algorithm calculating \fixme[very small regions of
delay.]{crindt}{Give an example of this}

The second method was to alter the objective function to weight the
cells based upon their time-space proximity to the estimated location
of the incident.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:distance-weighting}
    \min\limits_{\delta_{jm}} Z = \sum\limits_{\forall{}j,m}\bigg(\left|L - \overline{L}\right|\cdot{}\left[P_{jm}\cdot{}\delta_{jm}+(1-P_{jm})(1-\delta_{jm})\right]\bigg)
\end{equation}
where $\left|L - \overline{L}\right|$ is the normalized distance in
time and space between the cell and the estimated location of the
event disruption.  By weighting cells that are further from the
expected location of the incident higher, this objective emphasizes
matching the evidence near the event disruption more than that
evidence further away from the incident.  

%%\fixme{crindt}{Create before and after figure of the importance of
%%   this method.}

We note that the use of this method was made possible by the
improvements made to the \ac{TMC} activity log to add geospatial
coordinates from the \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} system to the incident logs
(see section~\ref{sec:activity-data}).


\subsubsection{Maximum incident speed}
\label{sec:max-inc-spd}

Empirical analysis of incidents analyzed using the original delay calculation
method showed that in some cases the use of the $\alpha$ threshold to identify
likely areas of incident-induced congestion would occasionally produce evidence
that extended significantly beyond what was apparent to the analyst.  
% An example
% of this situation is shown in \fixme[figure~\ref{fig:max-inc-spd}]{crindt}{Make
%   this a side by side before/after comparison}.
% \begin{figure}[t]
%   \centering
%   \caption{Illustrating the need for a maximum incident speed}
%   \label{fig:max-inc-spd}
% \end{figure}
After analyzing a number of incidents exhibiting this problem, we noticed that
these incidents all tended to have relatively high observed speeds
($\hat{s}_j(t_m)>65\unitfrac{mi}{h}$) and low standard deviations
($\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}<2\unitfrac{mi}{h}$).  In these situations, minor
fluctuations in observed speeds are tagged as evidence of incident conditions
when they likely are not (though the may indicate the imminent onset of delay).
Such noise in the evidence results in poor performance for the algorithm.

The obvious solution to this problem was to adjust the $\alpha$ parameter to be
greater than 0.25 value determined in earlier research.  However, we found that
in many cases the problem would only disappear with $\alpha>3.5$, but such a
high $\alpha$ degraded the method's performance for incidents where
$\hat{s}_j(t_m)<65\unitfrac{mi}{h}$.

The best solution we found, however, was to alter the evidence
definition to adjust the definition of the evidence $P_{jm}$ to always
indicate non-incident conditions if the observed speed
$\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ is greater than some \emph{maximum incident speed}
threshold $\hat{s}_{max}$.  Rewriting equation~(\ref{eq:pjm-final}),
we have:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pjm-final-2}
  P_{jm} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \ge n_{\textrm{minobs}};\hat{s}_j(t_m) < \hat{s}_{max} \\
    1;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) > \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \ge n_{\textrm{minobs}}\\
    0.5;& n_{\mathrm{obs}} < n_{\textrm{minobs}}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

With this new evidence definition, we determined empirically that the
combination of $\hat{s}_{max}=65\unitfrac{mi}{h}$ and $\alpha=1.0$
produced consistent results for a range of incident severities and
speeds.


% \subsection{Alternative method for computing TMC impacts}
% \label{sec:alt-tmc-meth}

% The statistical techniques described in section~\ref{sec:det-cong-reg} used to
% determine the evidence that a given time-space freeway segment is experiencing
% abnormal conditions is admittedly simple.  In this section, we present a
% bottom-up, data-driven approach to modeling traffic behavior from loop-sensor
% measurements.  In section~\ref{sec:model} we describe an unsupervised method
% that simultaneously filters out sensor failure, learns the underlying normal
% traffic pattern, and separates and characterizes unusual event activity.
% Section~\ref{sec:applications} shows how the output of the model can be used in
% various applications, including detecting unusual activity, detecting and
% filtering sensor failure, finding the spatio-temporal signature of accidents,
% and creating a ranked list of traffic
% disruptions.  % The concluding section discusses ??? %other traffic modeling problems we would like to pursue in the future.

% \subsubsection{Model Description}\label{sec:model}
% Figure~\ref{fig:model} shows three time-segments of the graphical
% model for the loop sensor event model. The flow and occupancy
% processes are joined together via a Markov event process forming two
% Markov modulated nonhomogeneous Poisson processes[scott00] (MMNHPP).
% We will discuss each component process in turn.
% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=4.5in, height=3.5in]{eps/mmppNew.pdf}
%   \caption{Three time segments of the Markov model }\label{fig:model}
% \end{figure}




% \paragraph{Event Process: Modeling Rare, Persistent Events}\label{sec:event}
% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
% %  \includegraphics[width=3.5in, height=2in]{eps/event.eps}
%   \caption{Three time segments of the }\label{fig:eventGM}
% \end{figure}


% The anomalous measurements that occur during an event caused by a
% traffic accident or a large concert for example, can be intuitively
% thought of as being due to a random process changes the observed
% behavior, increasing or decreasing the measurement for a short period
% of time.  We characterize events as high or low, indicating that the
% anomalous measurements are larger or smaller than what we would
% normally expect.  In addition, we expect the event type to have
% continuity; i.e. continuously positive rather than alternating between
% positive and negative from one time segment to the next.  Modeling the
% event process using a Markov chain, as seen in
% figure~\ref{fig:eventGM}, allows us to encode the concept that an
% event has persistence, but is relatively short in duration and
% relatively rare and the concept of continuity.

% Continuity is achieved in part by defining the event state variable,
% $z_t$.  In our system we define 8 event states
% \begin{equation}
%  z_t = \begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{if there is no event at time $t$} \\
%                       1 & \mbox{if there is a high flow, high occupancy event at time $t$} \\
%                       2 & \mbox{if there is a high flow, low occupancy event at time $t$} \\
%                       3 & \mbox{if there is a low flow, low occupancy event at time $t$} \\
%                       4 & \mbox{if there is a low flow, high occupancy event at time $t$} \\
%                       5 & \mbox{if there is a high flow, normal occupancy event at time $t$} \\
%                       6 & \mbox{if there is a normal flow, high occupancy event at time $t$} \\
%                       7 & \mbox{if there is a sensor failure at time $t$ }
%        \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% and define the probability distribution over $z_t$ to be Markov in
% time, with transition probability matrix $A$
% \begin{equation}
%   A = \left( \begin{matrix} a_{00} & a_{01} & \cdots \\ a_{10} & a_{11} & \cdots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots  \end{matrix} \right)
% \end{equation}\label{singleSensor:transitionMatrix}
% where $a_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to
% state $j$, and where each row of $A$ sums to 1.

% The parameters of the transition matrix enable us to build in the
% concepts of persistence and rarity of events, as well as consistency
% of events.  Persistency is encoded in the event self-transition
% parameters. For example, the expected value of the length of a {high
%   flow, high occupancy} event is $1/(1-a_{11})$.  Rarity of events is
% encoded in the no-event to no-event transition parameter, the expected
% number of time segments before seeing an event being $1/(1-a_{00})$.
% Continuity is managed by making the event self-transition parameters
% much larger than the event-to-event transition parameters (eg. $a_{11}
% >> a_{12}, a_{13}$ etc.).

% These parameters create ``soft'' rules that guide the model to
% recognize events as we understand them.  
% % We will show later in
% % Section~\ref{sec:eventDetect} that these parameters do not
% % \fixme[Failure... event to event transition not unusual, but frequent]{crindt}{wha?}


% The number of time-segments between events is geometric with expected value
% $1/z^{01}$ (in units of time-segments), and the length of each event is
% geometric with expected value $1/z^{10}$.  We give $z^{00}$, $z^{11}$ priors
% \begin{equation}
%  z^{00} \sim \beta(z^{00};a_{00},b_{00}) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
%  z^{11} \sim \beta(z^{11};a_{11},b_{11})
% \end{equation}
% where $\beta(\cdot)$ is the Beta distribution, and $a_{00}$, $b_{00}$, and
% $a_{11}$, $b_{11}$ are parameters for the two Beta priors.

% The event process is modeled as an HMM (see
% Chapter~\ref{background:HMM}), as illustrated in
% Figure~\ref{singleSensor:eventGM}.  Given $z_t$, we can model the
% increase in observation counts due to the event, $e_t$, as Poisson
% with rate $\gamma$
% \begin{equation}
%  e_t \sim \begin{cases} 0 & z_t = 0 \\ \poisson(e ; \gamma) & z_t = 1 \end{cases}
% \end{equation}\label{singleSensor:eventCount1}
% and $\gamma$ is independent at each time $t$
% \begin{equation}
%  \gamma \sim \Gamma(\gamma ; a^E, b^E).
% \end{equation}\label{singleSensor:eventCount2}
% where a and b are parameters of the Gamma distribution and the
% superscript $E$ indicates the event process.

% Just as there are different Poisson rate parameters for different
% times-of-day in the normal process, one can imagine different Poisson
% rate parameters for the event process based on time.  However,
% although the observed time and day indicate the appropriate normal
% process rate parameter to use (e.g. traffic Monday mornings at 11am at
% a specific sensor location is generally predictable), the same cannot
% be said for the event process (event traffic on Monday morning at 11am
% might be due to a small event with relatively little extra traffic or
% due to a large event with more traffic).

% One method of approaching this problem of different sized events would
% be to define several event types and let the model learn the
% appropriate rate parameters for each type (perhaps extra traffic due
% to large sporting events has one distribution and extra traffic due to
% concerts has a different distribution); however, not only does this
% increase computational complexity, it could make the model overly
% flexible and too sensitive to naturally occurring noise in the count
% measurements (see Section~\ref{singleSensor:poisson} and
% Chapter~\ref{sensitivity}).  A more robust solution is to marginalize
% over $\gamma$ analytically
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:nbin}
%   \int \poisson(e; \gamma) \Gamma(\gamma; a^E,b^E) = \nbin(e; a^E, b^E/(1+b^E))
% \end{equation}
% where $\nbin$ is the negative binomial distribution with parameters
% $a^E$ and $b^E/(1+b^E)$.

% This negative binomial distribution has a larger variance than the
% Poisson distribution, and is thus able to model a ``catch-all'' event
% type that gives some probability mass to event counts from
% various-sized event types.




\section{Modeling {TMC} impacts}
\label{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}

The following details a method for computing transient or
oversaturated queues caused by incident conditions subject to critical
parameters under the influence of \ac{TMC} operations---particularly
the time to respond to an incident. It represents the basis of the
approach we use to model the benefits of the \ac{TMC}.

We begin by describing the typical capacity-disrupting incident. Let
\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[$A(t)$] = Cumulative quantity (or number of vehicles) to arrive
  by time t.
\item[$D(t)$] = Cumulative quantity (or number of vehicles) to have
  been serviced by time t.
\item[$Q(t)=A(t)-D(t)$] = Number of vehicles in the queue (or queue
  length) at time t.
\end{description}
\end{quote}
Suppose that the arrival rate, queue, and time interval are
sufficiently large so that random fluctuations in the number of
arrivals can be considered small compared to the observed number of
arrivals; i.e., the Law of Large Numbers applies:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lln}
  \Pr\left\{\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{A(t)-E\{A(T)\}}{E\{A(t)\}}\right\} 
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{eq:lln}) implies that $A(t), D(t)$ can be approximated by
non-random continuous variables.

For example, when $Q(0)=1$, and we have a steady arrival rate $\lambda
\Rightarrow A(t) = \lambda t$ , and a constant service rate $\mu \Rightarrow D(t)
= \mu t, Q(t)>0$, then, 
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:arrival-and-queues}
  A(t) & = Q(0) + \lambda t \Rightarrow \lambda = \frac{dA(t)}{dt}\\
  Q(t) & = Q(0) + (\lambda - \mu ) t; \: Q(t) \ge 0
\end{align*}
These conditions are shown in figure~\ref{fig:queuing-constant-rates}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/queuing-undersat-and-oversat}
    \caption[Queuing under constant arrival and service rates]{Queuing
      under constant arrival and service rates.  In both figures, a
      queue of length $Q(0)$ exists at time 0 and there is some
      constant arrival rate $A(t)=\lambda$.  The figure on the left
      shows the dissipation of the queue when the arrival rate is less
      than the service rate $\lambda<\mu$.  The figure on the right
      shows the increasing queue caused by the oversaturated conditions
      $\lambda>\mu$.}
    \label{fig:queuing-constant-rates}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
 
In the general case, the arrival rate $\lambda$ is not restricted to constant and we have:
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:gen-arr}
  A(t) = \int\lambda(\tau)d\tau \Rightarrow \lambda(t) = \frac{dA(t)}{dt} 
\end{equation*}
Consider flow conditions following an incident that causes the
capacity (or service rate $\mu(t)$) to fall below the demand (or
arrival rate $\lambda(t)$ ) for a period during which the incident is
identified, verified, and actions are taken to restore capacity to its
pre-incident conditions.  Assume that the demand remains constant
during this period; i.e., $\lambda(t) = \mathrm{constant} = \lambda$.
Prior to the incident, $D(t) \equiv A(t)$.  With the onset of the
incident, the resulting queue $Q(t)$ can be expected to start off
small, rise to a peak (maximum) during the process of clearing (owing
to removal activity at the scene), then gradually subside as capacity
is restored. Note that, at some time during the clearing process, the
rate of growth of the queue will be slowed by actions taken at the
scene to begin to restore capacity. Note also that $Q(t)$ will reach
its maximum precisely when capacity has been restored to a level that
is equal to the demand $\lambda$; assuming that the full capacity of
the section is greater than $\lambda$ (if, not, the queue will be
persistent), clearing of the incident ultimately will permit the queue
to be dissipated. This is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:general-incident-queuing}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]

    \caption{The formation of a queuing for a typical incident}
    \label{fig:general-incident-queuing} 
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Here, the arrival rate is less than the service rate, i.e., $\lambda <
\mu$, until $t_0$ and the queue is essentially zero, i.e., $Q(t)
\equiv 0, 0 \le t \le t_0$. Beyond $t_0$, $\lambda > \mu$ so that the
queue grows until $t_2$---the point at which the rate of service rate
$A(t)$ and demand rate $D(t)$ are equal.  From $t_2$ until $t_3$, the
queue diminishes until $t_3$, when $D(t_3) = A(t_3), t \ge t_3$ as
shown in figure~\ref{fig:arrival-service-and-queuing}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]

    \inputTikZ{figs/arrival-service-and-queuing}
    \caption[The relationship between the arrival rate, the service
    rate, and queuing during an incident response]{The relationship
      between the arrival rate ($\lambda(t)$), the service rate
      ($\mu$), and queuing ($Q(t)$) during an incident response.}
    \label{fig:arrival-service-and-queuing}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

From the perspective of \ac{TMC} operations, the corresponding incident
response would look something like
figure~\ref{fig:tmc-resp-and-queuing}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Computing queues caused by incident congestion}
\label{sec:comp-queues}

We now turn to the problem of computing delay as a function of the
critical time points of incident response that can be influenced by
\ac{TMC} actions.

\subsubsection*{Case of slight oversaturation}

Suppose the time period during which $\lambda > \mu$ is relatively
short, i.e., $t_2 - t_0$ is relatively small.\fixme{caltrans}{Demand
  is greater than capacity between t0 and t2.  From t2 to t3 the
  capacity exceeds the demand.  From your explanation, it appears that
  this time period should be t2-t0 rather than t3-t0!  Please
  explain. To be consistent with equation 3.25, this time period
  should be t2-t0.  crindt: The critique is correct, it should be
  $t_2-t_0$} Then, expand $\mu(t)$ as a Taylor series about $t_1$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mu-expansion}
  \mu(t) = \mu(t_1)+\frac{d\mu}{dt}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} \cdot{}(t-t_1)
  +\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} \cdot{}(t-t_1)^2
  +O(t-t_1)^3
\end{equation}
But, $\frac{d\mu}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow$
%
\fixme{caltrans}{What are the reasons and the logic that are needed to
  make Taylor Series applicable.  Can this assumption be used during a
  major incident where blockage is present for over an hour?  crindt:
  Indeed, the longer the incident, the less valid this result is.
  However, keep in mind that the methods described herein are focused
  on identifying delay savings due to TMC actions that speed the
  clearance of accidents.  In the case of an incident that requires a
  long duration to clear, the importance of the speed of the response
  is diminished.  Put more bluntly, if it takes 6 hours to clear an
  incident, then it matter little in terms of total delay whether the
  first response is 10 minutes slower or faster.}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \label{eq:mu-expansion-simpl}
  \mu(t) & = \mu(t_1)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1}\cdot(t-t_1)^2+O(t-t_1)^3 \\
  ~& = \mu(t_1)+\beta (t-t_1)^2 + O(t-t_1)^3, t_0 \le t \le t_3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:beta}
  \beta = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} \: (\mathrm{Note:}\: \beta > 0).
\end{equation}
Observe, at $t=t_0$, (\ref{eq:mu-expansion-simpl}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mu-at-t0}
  \mu(t_0) = \mu(t_1) + \beta \cdot (t_0-t_1)^2+O(t_0-t_1)^3
\end{equation}
Also, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-at-t0}
\begin{split}
  \lambda & = \lambda(t_0) = \mu(t_0) \Rightarrow \\
  \lambda & = \mu(t_0) = \mu(t_1) + \beta \cdot
  (t_0-t_1)^2+O(t_0-t_1)^3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Similarly
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-at-t2}
  \lambda = \lambda(t_2) = \mu(t_2) = \mu(t_1) + \beta \cdot (t_2-t_1)^2+O(t_2-t_1)^3
\end{equation}
Solving (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t0}) for $t_0$ and (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t2})
for $t_2$, neglecting terms $O(t_2 - t_1)^3$ and $O(t_0 - t_1 )^3$ we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t1-t2-implications}
  \begin{split}
    (t_0-t_2)^2 = \frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta} \Rightarrow t_0-t_1 & = \pm\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    t_1>t_0 \Rightarrow t_0 & = t_1 - \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    (t_2-t_1)^2 = \frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta} \Rightarrow t_2 - t_1 & = \pm\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    t_2>t_1 \Rightarrow t_2 & = t_1  + \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Observe from (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t0}) and (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t2}),
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mu-lambda-roots}
  (\lambda - \mu(t))\rvert_{t=t_0} = (\lambda - \mu(t))\rvert_{t=t_2} = 0
\end{equation}
And, from (\ref{eq:mu-expansion-simpl}) we see that $\mu(t)$ is a quadratic in $t$,
so that $\lambda-\mu(t)$ is also a quadratic in $t$ (since $\lambda$
is a constant).  From (\ref{eq:mu-lambda-roots}), $\lambda - \mu(t)$ has
roots $t=t_0,t_2$.  So, $\lambda - \mu(t)$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-mu-form}
  \lambda-\mu(t) = c(t-t_0)(t-t_2)
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:beta})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:d2mudt}
  \beta = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1}
  \Rightarrow \frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} = 2\beta
\end{equation}
Taking ${d^2}/{dt^2}$ of (\ref{eq:lambda-mu-form}) and comparing
to (\ref{eq:d2mudt}), we get
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2} = 2c \:\Rightarrow\:
  \frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1}=2c \:\Rightarrow\: c = \beta
\end{equation*}
So
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-mu-beta}
  \lambda - \mu(t) = \beta(t-t_0)(t-t_2)
\end{equation}
Recall that the queue at any time $t_0 \le t \le t_3$  is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-def}
  Q(t)=A(t)-D(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\left[\lambda(\tau)-\mu(\tau)\right]d\tau
\end{equation}
For the case of a constant arrival rate, $\lambda$, (\ref{eq:qt-def})
becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-def-2}
  Q(t)=A(t)-D(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\left[\lambda-\mu(\tau)\right]d\tau
\end{equation}
Or, from (\ref{eq:lambda-mu-beta})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-def-beta}
  Q(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\left[\beta(\tau-t_0)(\tau-t_2)\right]d\tau
\end{equation}
Integrate (\ref{eq:qt-def-beta}) by parts:
\begin{align*}
  u & = (\tau-t_2) & dv & = (\tau-t_0)d\tau\\
  du & = d\tau & v & = \frac{1}{2}(\tau - t_0)^2
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-final}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t) & =\int_{t_0}^t\left[\beta(\tau-t_0)(\tau-t_2)\right]d\tau
    = \beta\left\{\frac{(\tau-t_2)(\tau-t_0)^2}{2}\Biggr\rvert_{t_0}^{t}
      - \frac{1}{2}\int_{t_0}^t(\tau-t_0)^2d\tau\right\}\\
    &= \beta\left\{\frac{(\tau-t_2)(\tau-t_0)^2}{2}\Biggr\rvert_{t_0}^{t}
      - \frac{1}{6}(\tau-t_0)^3\Biggr\rvert_{t_0}^{\tau}\right\}\\ 
    &= \beta\left\{\frac{(t-t_2)(t-t_0)^2}{2}
      - \frac{1}{6}(t-t_0)^3\right\}\\ 
    &= \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{(t-t_2)}{2}
      - \frac{(t-t_0)}{6}\right\}\\ 
    &= \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{(t-t_0)}{3}
      - \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2}\right\}\\ 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Asymptotic behavior}~\\

For \emph{$\lim_{t\to t_0+} Q(t)$}, we have:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-asymp-at-t0}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t) = \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{(t-t_0)}{3}
      - \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2}\right\}\\ 
    \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2} \gg \frac{(t-t_0)}{3} 
    \Rightarrow Q(t) \approx \beta(t-t_0)^2(t_2-t_0)/2
  \end{split}
\end{equation}


\vspace{1em}\noindent\emph{$\lim_{t\to t_0+} Q(t)$:}
At $t=t_2$, $Q(t)$ reaches its maximum:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:max-qt}
  Q(t_2) =\frac{\beta}{6}(t_2-t_0)^3
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:t1-t2-implications}), i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    t_0 & = t_1 - \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    t_2 & = t_1  + \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Then,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:combined-t0-t2}
  (t_2-t_0) = 2\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
So,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:q-t2}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t_2)& = \frac{4}{3}\beta\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}\\
    & = \frac{4\left[\lambda-\mu(t_1)\right]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}}{4\beta^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}} \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Or,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-prop-oversat}
  Q(t_2) \propto [\mathrm{Oversaturation}]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}
\end{equation}
Note that $Q(t)$ vanishes at $t=t_3$, i.e., $Q(t_3)=0$.  Then, from~(\ref{eq:qt-final})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t_3) =\beta(t_3-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{t_2-t_0}{2}-\frac{t_3-t_0}{3}\right\} & = 0 \Rightarrow  \\
    \frac{t_2-t_0}{2}-\frac{t_3-t_0}{3} = 0 \\
    t_3 = t_0 + \frac{3}{2}(t_2-t_0)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:t1-t2-implications})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t2-ito-t1-t0}
  t_0 + t_2 = 2t_1 \Rightarrow t_2 = 2t_1 - t_0
\end{equation}
Substituting (\ref{eq:t2-ito-t1-t0}) into (\ref{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2}), we
get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t3-ito-t1-t0}
  t_3 = t_0 + 3(t_1-t_0)
\end{equation}
Consider
\begin{equation*}
  Q(t) = \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{t_2-t_0}{2}-\frac{t-t_0}{3}\right\}
\end{equation*}
But, from (\ref{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t-relate}
  \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2} = \frac{(t_3-t_0)}{3}
\end{equation}
Substituting (\ref{eq:t-relate}) into the expression for $Q(t)$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-ito-t3-t0}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t)&=\beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{t_3-t_0}{3}-\frac{t_3-t_0}{3}\right\}\\
    &=\beta(t-t_0)^2(t_3-t)/3
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Relative size of queue}
\label{sec:rel-size-queue}

Define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qhat-def}
  \hat{Q}(t) = \frac{Q(t)}{\max\limits_t Q(t)} = \frac{Q(t)}{Q(t_2)}
\end{equation}
Let
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t-hat-def}
  \hat{t}=\frac{(t-t_0)}{t_3-t_0}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qhat-final}
  \begin{split}
  \hat{Q} & =\frac{\beta(t-t_0)^2(t_3-t)/3}{\beta(t_2-t_0)^3/6}\\
  &= 2\frac{\hat{t}^2(t_3-t_0)^2(t_3-t)}{(t_2-t_0)^3}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Total delay}
\label{sec:total-delay}

Observe that the total delay, $D_{\mathrm total}$, is simply
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-def}
  D_{\mathrm total} = \int\limits_{t_0}^{t_3}Q(\tau)d\tau
\end{equation}
From (\ref{eq:qt-ito-t3-t0})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-q3-q0-sub}
  D_{\mathrm total} = \frac{\beta}{3}\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_3}(\tau-t_0)(t_3-\tau)d\tau
\end{equation}
Let $\eta = (t-t_0) \Rightarrow d\eta = d\tau$.  Then (\ref{eq:dtot-q3-q0-sub}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-ito-eta}
  D_{\mathrm total} = \frac{\beta}{3}\int\limits_{0}^{t_3-t_0}\eta^2(t_3-t_0-\eta)d\eta
\end{equation}
Let $\phi = \eta/(t_3-t_0) \Rightarrow d\phi = d\eta/(t_3-t_0)$.
Then~(\ref{eq:dtot-ito-eta}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-ito-phi}
  \begin{split}
    D_{\mathrm total} & = \frac{\beta}{3}(t_3-t_0)^4\int\limits_{0}^{1}\phi^2(1-\phi)d\phi \\
    & = \frac{\beta}{3}(t_3-t_0)^4\left(\frac{\phi^3}{3}-\frac{\phi^4}{4}\right)\Biggr\rvert_{0}^{1} \\
  & = \frac{\beta}{3}(t_3-t_0)^4\left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}\right) \\
  & = \frac{\beta}{36}(t_3-t_0)^4
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2}) and (\ref{eq:combined-t0-t2})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t3-t0-def}
  t_3-t_0=3(t_2-t_0)/2 = 3\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
So, substituting (\ref{eq:t3-t0-def}) into~(\ref{eq:dtot-ito-phi}), we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-ito-beta-t1}
  \begin{split}
    D_{\mathrm total} &= \frac{\beta}{36}(81)\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]\\
    &= \frac{9[\lambda-\mu(t_1)]^2}{4\beta}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
So, total delay is proportional to the square of the amount of
oversaturation, $[\lambda-\mu(t_1)]$, \textbf{or} to the 4\textsuperscript{th} power of the peak, $(t_3-t_0)$; i.e.,
\begin{subequations}
  \label{dtot-final}
  \begin{align}
    D_{\mathrm total} & \propto [\lambda-\mu(t_1)]^2 \label{eq:dtot-ito-oversat}\\
    D_{\mathrm total} & \propto (t_3-t_0)^4 \label{eq:dtot-ito-peak}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Estimating tangible TMC benefits}
\label{sec:est-benefits}

Equations (\ref{dtot-final}) offer a tool for estimating \ac{TMC}
benefits from measurable events in the \ac{TMC} activity logs.
Specifically, if we can determine from \ac{TMC} logs how much the time
to initial response to an incident $t_1$ is shortened by \ac{TMC}
actions, we can estimate the delay savings attributable to \ac{TMC}
functions.  Furthermore, if these actions can be associated with
specific processes or technologies, we can make statements regarding
the delay savings attributable to specific \ac{TMC} assets (or bundles
of them). The extent to which this is possible depends on the quality
of data in the \ac{TMC} logs, which has been a motivating factor
behind the improvements to the \ac{TMC} activity logs discussed in
chapter~\ref{chap:tmc-activity}.

\chapter{System architecture}
\label{sec:system-architecture}


In this chapter we detail how the \ac{TMC} incident performance evaluation
system has been made available for use in regular \ac{TMC} operations using the
flexible service-oriented architecture deployed at the \ac{CTMLabs}.

\section{Use Cases}
\label{sec:use-cases}


The \ac{TMC} performance evaluation system could potentially be used in a
variety of settings. The primary use-case is to allow \ac{TMC} personnel to
perform post-analysis of incidents that have occurred in order to produce a
measure of the value of \acp{TMC} to Caltrans and the State of California. In
this role, the system must operate as an easy-to-use reporting system with which
the analyst can specify a set of analytical parameters defining the incidents to
analyze, any necessary modeling assumptions, and \ac{TMC} components to
model. The ideal interface will be accessible from any authenticated computer
and will use technology already familiar to operators.

A second potential use-case for the evaluation system is a real-time
mode that attempts to forecast the cost of delaying action on current
incidents. While this use is not a part of this initial project, it
would be a potentially straightforward extension of the core models to
provide real-time decision support to \ac{TMC} personnel actively
engaged in managing multiple simultaneous incidents. In this role, the
evaluation system would operate in the background, occasionally
broadcasting estimates to other software components for them to
integrate into existing \ac{TMC} processes.

A third use-case is that the performance evaluation system might be integrated
into existing or future software systems used by Caltrans and its partners. One
obvious example includes the \ac{PeMS} system, which performs similar functions
with less detail. This project is a natural extension to that existing work and
may therefore be a candidate for integration.

This software is intended to support a process or set of processes carried out
by \ac{TMC} operators and traffic engineers.  Toward that end, the system should
integrate as cleanly as possible with existing processes and the software used
to support them.  We note, however, that existing systems in the Caltrans
District 12 \ac{TMC} tend to be monolithic (and generally proprietary)
applications---particularly as regards their user interfaces.  This makes
integrating new software into the \ac{TMC} very challenging and potentially
expensive.

To overcome these barriers, \ac{TMCPE} system is being deployed using horizontal
integration strategies that separate core logic and data from the user
interfaces used to interact with them.  The initial interface to the system will
focus on the post-analysis use-case and will be web-browser based since that is
a platform that will be familiar to virtually all users.  Integration of the
system into any real-time operations will require further study.  Nonetheless,
the architecture of the system should be flexible enough to allow such
deployment in the future.

\section{Service-Oriented Architecture}
\label{sec:soa}

The \ac{TMC} performance evaluation system was being implemented using a
service-oriented architecture (SOA) whose logical flows as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:logical-system-arch}. A collection of existing databases provide
raw data to the Incident Impact Model.  An analysis scheduler is configured to
regularly execute performance analysis of incidents to generate baseline delays
estimates.  Analysts can use the \ac{TMC} impact model via a web interface to
analyze the benefits of the \ac{TMC} for any identified incident.

A possible future extension of the system for real-time delay estimation is not
shown in the figure. In this mode, a Real-time Delay Estimator component would
actively monitor the system for identified incidents, and would query the
incident impact model to estimate the relative costs of delaying action on all
active incidents. These results could be broadcast to any \ac{TMC} management
application to assist operators in prioritizing \ac{TMC} actions.  We discuss
each of these components in the following sections.

      adminstrator working with the Analysis Scheduler.}

\subsection{TMC activity data}
\label{sec:activity-data}

In the first interim report for this project
\citep{rindt08:_measur_based_system_for_tmc_perfor_evaluat} we noted
that
\begin{quote}
  The District 12 \ac{TMC} activity log records sufficient \ac{TMC} activity to
  perform the basic delay calculation and evaluate a limited portion of the
  benefits provided by the \ac{TMC}. For the activity log to be more generally
  useful to performance evaluation, entries in the log should be tied both to
  specific technologies that offer notable impacts on \ac{TMC} processes or to
  procedures that are designed to have intended effects.
\end{quote}
These recommendations were folded into a set of modifications made to the
District 12 \ac{TMC} activity log application under UCI subaward \#2009-2291
between \emph{Special Solutions} and UCI.  The details of this work is included in
Appendix~\ref{chap:actlog-sub}.  The most significant changes with respect to
the \ac{TMCPE} analysis is that the activity log was modified to:
\begin{itemize}
\item log the specific critical events outlined in
  chapter~\ref{chap:tmc-activity};
\item embed the data from the \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} log (see
  section~\ref{sec:chp-icad-log}) in the activity log database to
  provide a range of additional event information---most notably a
  geocoded location for the incident previously absent from the event
  dataset; and
\item include the data from the \ac{TMC} Radio Communications logs (RLOG),
  which offer additional information about resource allocation during
  incident management.
\end{itemize}

In order to shield the production database from unnecessary loads from
\ac{TMCPE} users, the development team decided to mirror the \ac{TMC} activity
log database to a secure \ac{CTMLabs} server.  This mirror is further processed
during \ac{TMCPE} analysis to remove any sensitive data such as phone numbers.
Consequently, the web application has no access to the raw sensitive data of the
source database.


\subsection{PeMS 5 minute database}
\label{sec:pems-5-min}

The \ac{TMCPE} service depends on the availability of 5-minute speed and volume
data for each section of roadway being analyzed.  Though \ac{CTMLabs} has
multiple sources for this data (see section~\ref{sec:system-data}), the team
concluded that the \ac{PeMS} dataset was the most reliable.  The \ac{CTMLabs}
deployment therefore mirrors the \ac{PeMS} \ac{VAR} feed, which provides
5-minute section speeds and volumes.  These are mirrored onto the \ac{CTMLabs}
dataserver at 5 minute intervals and are loaded into the \ac{CTMLabs} \ac{PeMS}
database.

In addition to the 5-minute speeds and volumes, the \ac{TMCPE} delay
calculation requires the computation of the expected distribution of
flow and speed for affected sections by time-of-day and day-of-week.
This is computed using a rolling 52-week horizon as described in
equation~(\ref{eq:nominal-speed-obs}).  Since this is a relatively
expensive computation, it is performed only once on demand the first
time an analysis needs it, and then is cached in the local copy of the
\ac{PeMS} database.  A saved query (also known as a database
\emph{view}) is stored in the database that automatically selects the
distribution from the cache, if available, or triggers the computation
of a new distribution if it is missing.  This caching improves the
performance of the web application significantly.


\subsection{TMCPE application database}
\label{sec:tmcpe-app-database}

All domain data generated by the \ac{TMCPE} application are stored in the
application database.  This includes all incident analyses and their components
(such as individual facility analyses).  The details of the domain objects
stored in this database are discussed in section~\ref{sec:components} below.
%%\fixme{crindt}{Too short to be a standalone section}


\section{Components}
\label{sec:components}

The main components of the performance evaluation system fall into two
categories: business logic components that process data to produce new metrics
for use in the \ac{TMC} and interface components that expose that data to other
software or to users in the \ac{TMC}.  

Currently, the core business logic, including the \ac{TMCPE} computations is
implemented using custom \texttt{perl} scripts and the commercial \ac{GAMS}
optimization software \citep{rosenthal10:_gams}.  The user interface is
implemented using the \texttt{Grails} web application framework
\citep{rocher09:_grail_framew_refer_docum}.  Both \texttt{perl} and
\texttt{Grails} offer persistence mechanisms for reading and writing data
to/from the databases.  However, because \texttt{Grails} is a
convention-oriented framework while \texttt{perl} is more of a general purpose
toolkit that is easier to adapt, we decided to allow \texttt{Grails} to manage
the database schemas where they are shared between the business and user
interface components.  The \texttt{Grails} persistence mechanism is built atop
the industry standard \texttt{Hibernate} persistence
\citep{king10:_hiber_relat_persis_idiom_java} engine, and consequently has
enterprise stability and scalability.

Thus, the general flow of development is to define the domain classes in the
\texttt{Grails} framework, allow \texttt{Hibernate} to generate (and update) the
database schemas as necessary, and then automatically pull the new schemas into
the \texttt{perl} business logic using the \texttt{DBIx::Class} \texttt{perl}
module.  This approach has proven robust and flexible in the development of the
system.


\subsection{Business Logic}
\label{sec:logic}


\subsubsection{Incident impact service}

\label{sec:incident-impact-service}

This component encapsulates the incident impact model described in
section~\ref{sec:incident-impact-model}.  It only requires the
activity log ID as input and will automatically query the sensor
database and \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} data to obtain further data necessary
for the analysis.  The service returns a list of impacted sections and
associated delay calculations.

The core models for the incident impact service have been developed using a
program written in the \texttt{perl} scripting language.  The high-level logic
for this service is as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\sc \textbf{Obtain Event Data}}: Query activity log database
  for unanalyzed events since last run
\item {\sc\textbf{Preprocess Events}}: For each unanalyzed event
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Loop over the activity and communications logs and:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the event type based upon the \ac{iCAD} ID of the event,
      which falls into the following broad categories: incidents (accidents,
      etc.), special events (like sporting events,) 
      maintenance/construction activities.
    \item Import privacy scrubbed data into the application database.
    \item Identify performance measures information needed to
      formulate the delay calculation.
    \item Use \ac{iCAD} geocoding (where available) and activity log
      location strings to identify the approximate time-space location
      of the event's impact on the system.
    \item Create a \ac{TMCPE} event object representing the event and
      store it in the database.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\item {\sc\textbf{Compute Incident Impact}}: For each \ac{TMCPE} event object
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Using the geocoded location of the approximate event site and
    the critical incident management events from the activity log,
    \fixme[estimate the maximum time-space bounds]{crindt}{more
      detail} of the event on primary and secondary facilities
  \item Query the \ac{PeMS} mirror database for observed speeds and flows
    for the maximum time-space impact region.
  \item Generate the mathematical program that estimates the range
    of incident impact
  \item Send the program to the \fixme[\ac{GAMS} service]{crindt}{explain} to
    be solved.
  \item Parse the results of the GAMS solution back into the \ac{TMCPE}
    domain classes for use by the \acp{API}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
% It involves three main steps: obtaining raw event data from all data sources,
% pre-processing that data to identify the location of the event and the critical
% incident management steps from the logs, and computing the incident and TMC
% impacts.

% \fixme{crindt}{Discuss parsing processing, may have to blow up diagram.}

%%\paragraph{Recommendations for future improvements}

The current implementation formulates the \ac{BIP} in
equations~(\ref{eq:bip-formulation}) for solution using the \ac{CPLEX} solver
under \ac{GAMS}.  At present, the solution time for determining the impacted
region on a single facility for a major incident is on the order of 60 seconds,
though actual solution time varies with the maximum possible range of impact for
a given incident and with the complexity of the evidence.  Since the number of
major incidents per day is relatively small, this performance is suitable for
batch processes that compute the baseline delays for a given day during the
course of the following night.  Still, it is likely that the (time) performance
of the solver can be improved by using algorithms more tuned for solving
\ac{BIP} problems.  Improved performance would give the analyst more flexibility
for re-running the solver with different parameters (e.g., $\alpha$, the maximum
duration, etc.) for a given incident.  This would, in turn, allow the web-based
interface to provide a better end-user experience.

Additionally, the improved statistical techniques considered during this
research
% discussed in
% section~\ref{sec:alt-tmc-meth} 
have great promise for providing more robust identification of the range of
impact for unexpected events in the system.  However, the implementation of
these methods are not sufficiently efficient to be incorporated into the live
application as it stands.  As they mature, however, they could be optimized to
function with the web application.


\subsubsection{TMC impact service}
\label{sec:tmc-impact-service}
The \ac{TMC} impact service encapsulates the \ac{TMC} impact model
resulting from the work described in
section~\ref{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}.  This service requires as input the
activity log ID of the incident to be analyzed, the output from the
incident impact service in order to characterize the critical section
and estimate the arrival pattern to the impacted region, and any
parameters characterizing changes to the observed incident response.
As with the incident impact service, this model independently accesses
additional databases as necessary to support its analysis.  The
service updates the \ac{TMCPE} domain classes for the event to include
the estimated delay savings attributable to actions characterized by
the input parameters.

As with the incident impact service, the core TMC impact service model
is implemented using the \texttt{perl} scripting language.  In its
current form, this service is a simplified version of the queuing
model described in section~\ref{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}.  This approach
focuses on identifying how a delay in incident response extends the
maximum length of an incident queue using shockwave analysis.  The
subsequent lengths of this projected queue over time is modeled using
maximum service rates measured during clearance of the actual
incident, which are in turn used to estimate additional delays.


\subsection{Interfaces}
\label{sec:interfaces}

The core logic generates data objects that can be adapted for the
use-cases described in section~\ref{sec:use-cases}.  To support these
applications, the architecture includes two main interfaces to the
core logical services.  

\paragraph{Web-based incident post-analysis tool}

The primary interface to the performance evaluation system is a
map-based web interface that allows an analyst to query the model for
\begin{itemize}
\item \ac{TMC} benefits (delay savings) for specific incidents
\item \ac{TMC} benefits for a set of incidents meeting particular criteria
  (location, time of day, severity, etc.)
\end{itemize}
The interface gives the analyst control of relevant input parameters
to the model, but assumes sensible defaults where possible.

The system uses a web-based interface built atop the Grails framework.
Within that framework, we implemented a map-based interface using the
OpenLayers \texttt{javascript} library
\citep{openlayers10:_openl_user_guide} and the OpenStreetMap map image
tiles \citep{openstreetmap.org10:_opens_devel_guide} (Google maps can
also be used as a background layer).  The web interface consists of
two main screens.

The first screen is a general query interface
(figure~\ref{fig:tmcpe-query-interface}) that allows the analyst to
select incidents using a variety of parameters ranging from the time
and date of the event to the event type.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tmcpe-query-interface.png}
    \caption{The TMCPE query interface.}
    \label{fig:tmcpe-query-interface}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
The query screen includes a map view and a scrollable table with summary
statistics for all incidents meeting the query criteria.  This interface allows
the user to select a particular incident to view a more detailed analysis.

The more detailed analysis of a particular incident is shown in the second
screen, which shows the analysis of the impacted facilities.  In this screen
(figure~\ref{fig:tmcpe-incident-detail-interface}) the time-space impacts are
displayed using a custom \texttt{javascript} widget developed for this project.
This widget displays a time-space diagram of the impacted region.  The screen
also includes a scrollable table holding the TMC activity and communications
logs for this event, which can be overlayed on the time-space diagram by
hovering over it.  A map view shows the location and prevailing conditions
during the event and detailed statistics from the analysis are displayed across
the top.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tmcpe-incident-detail.png}
    \caption{The TMCPE incident detail view.}
    \label{fig:tmcpe-incident-detail-interface}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\ifuserguide%
Additional detail of the user interface is provided in
appendix~\ref{chap:user-guide}.  
%
\fi

% \subsubsection{Incident status event channel}

% To support other use-cases involving integration of the incident delay
% model into \ac{TMC} operations or other external services, we will provide
% an event channel and associated external interface (using, e.g., SOAP
% or other web-based data feed technology) over which estimates from the
% core delay model will be broadcast to any subscribers.  These
% estimates, for instance, might be integrated into \ac{TMC} processes (and
% associated software) in order to prioritize incident response being
% managed by the \ac{TMC}.

% \paragraph{STATUS:} No work has been completed on the status event channel.


\subsubsection{CTMLabs API}
\label{sec:ctmlabs-api}

As part of its integration into the \ac{CTMLabs} architecture, the
\ac{TMCPE} analyses are offered as a service using the \ac{REST} style
of exposing services on the Internet
\citep{fielding00:_archit_styles_desig_networ_softw_archit} using the
CTMLabs \ac{API}.

The RESTful endpoint is authenticated using the \ac{CAS} server
deployed in the \ac{CTMLabs} and returns data formatted as
\ac{GeoJSON} objects \citep{butler08:_geojs_format_specif} as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:ctmlabs-api}\footnote{Technically, the \ac{API} uses a
  \texttt{javascript} pattern known as \ac{JSONP}
  \citep{özses09:_cross_jsonp_part} to avoid problems introduced by
  the \emph{same origin policy} enforced by web browsers.
  Effectively, however, the \ac{API} requires the affiliated
  website---\ac{TMCPE} in this case---to return a JSON object as
  described.}.  In the \ac{TMCPE} implementation of this \ac{API}, the
\texttt{memo} field is filled with the CAD id of the event in
question, the \texttt{locString} field with the facility and direction
of the affected section, and the \texttt{url} field with a link back
into the RESTful \ac{TMCPE} page for the associated analysis.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
\begin{singlespace}
\begin{verbatim}
{ "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    { "type":           "Feature",
      "id":             <appid>,         // optional
      "geometry":       <geojson geometry object>,
      "properties":    
         { "locString": <string describing location>,
           "memo":      <string describing data>,
           "url":       <link back to application url for this object>,
         }
    },
    { "type": "Feature"
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{singlespace}
\caption{CTMLabs API format}
  \label{fig:ctmlabs-api}
\end{figure}

Using this \ac{API}, the \ac{TMCPE} application has been integrated into the
\ac{CTMLabs} project interface, which shows the extent of the \ac{TMCPE} data
available, but does not expose the underlying details to
unauthenticated users.
%%\fixme{crindt}{Project interface picture}

\subsubsection{Interface security}
\label{sec:interface-security}

Access to the data on either of the above interfaces requires that the
user logs in to the \ac{CTMLabs} \ac{CAS} server to initiate a
session.  Only those \ac{CTMLabs} users that have been added to the
\ac{TMCPE} group on the \ac{CTMLabs} \ac{LDAP} server are permitted
access to the \ac{TMCPE} data.  All interfaces use secure sockets over
the HTTP protocol (HTTPS) to encrypt data over the Internet.

\subsection{Physical deployment of TMCPE Application}
\label{sec:arch}

The logical system architecture described above (see
figure~\ref{fig:logical-system-arch}) is designed to leverage existing software
under development for related research being carried out in the \ac{CTMLabs}.
The tasks that were required to deploy the \ac{TMC} Performance Evaluation
platform using this architecture are confined to the specification of the data
sources, business logic (software implementing the models described in
chapter~\ref{sec:method}), user interfaces, and information flows between those
components.

% Figure~\ref{fig:physical-architecture} shows how the \ac{TMCPE} web application
% was deployed for this project using \ac{CTMLabs} infrastructure.  
The \ac{TMCPE} web application was deployed for this project using existing
\ac{CTMLabs} infrastructure.  The system uses two \ac{CTMLabs} data servers for
its raw and application databases, two processing servers to implement the core
business logic and perform the computationally intense analysis, and one server
for deploying the web and API interfaces to users.  

Below, we discuss this architecture from the perspective of the events that
drive the system, namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item the availability of new data,
\item the processing of new data to produce incident analyses (the business
  logic), and
\item user interaction with the analysis product
\end{itemize}
% \begin{figure}[t]
%   \centering
%   \fixme{crindt}{Insert as-built about here and discuss}
%   \caption{Physical architecture of the TMCPE web application}
%   \label{fig:physical-architecture}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Incoming Data}
\label{sec:incoming-data}

As noted earlier, the data for the analysis comes from two main sources: the
\ac{PeMS} 5-minute \ac{VAR} data and the District 12 activity logs (which includes
the \ac{CHP} \ac{iCAD} data as one component).  The \ac{TMCPE} application is
designed to mirror this data.  

\paragraph{District 12 activity log replication}

In the case of the District 12 activity log, the production \texttt{MySQL} database
running in the District 12 sub network is replicated via a push mechanism to
\ac{CTMLabs}.  The mirroring occurs nightly at approximately 2am in order to
minimize the impact on the live activity log application in the \ac{TMC}.  The
scheduled process uses standard \texttt{MySQL} replication methods to push the
data to the firewalled \ac{CTMLabs} data server over the \ac{CTMLabs} data
intertie with District 12.

\paragraph{PeMS 5-minute data mirror}

The structure of the \ac{PeMS} data mirror differs slightly in that it is a
scheduled pull mechanism rather than a push.  \ac{PeMS} offers \acf{VAR}accounts
to users who can demonstrate a need for the data.  To support \ac{TMCPE}, we
established a \ac{VAR} account for \ac{CTMLabs}.  \ac{PeMS} publishes new
5-minute summary data for every \ac{VDS} in the system at roughly 5 minute
intervals to an authenticated \texttt{ftp} server.  The data remains on the
system for roughly an hour before it is deleted to make way for new data.  To
mirror this data, we created a \texttt{perl} script to check the \ac{PeMS}
\texttt{ftp} site for new data, download it, and push it into a \ac{CTMLabs}
database.  This script is scheduled to run every 5 minutes.


\subsubsection{New incident processing}
\label{sec:incident-processing}

To provide up-to-date incident analyses and statistics, the District 12 activity
log data received nightly is processed by \texttt{perl} scripts implementing the
core business logic.  These scripts are currently deployed across two servers.
The first machine is used to parse the newly received activity log data to
create incident summary objects and scrubbed activity log data in the \ac{TMCPE}
application database.

A critical part of this processing is to determine the approximate location of
the event's impact on the system.  For events prior to mid-2009, the locations
are determined by applying a recursive-descent parser to the activity log memo
field to identify operator-typed route/direction/cross street entries.  The
parser is designed to identify locations similar to the following:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
   NB-405 JSO JEFFREY RD
   EB-22 CONNECTOR TO SB-55
   5 N @ KATELLA
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The output from the parser is the \texttt{id} of the nearest mainline \ac{VDS}
matching the route, direction, and cross street parsed from the log.  The
\ac{VDS} lookup is performed using a database query that searches for the
\ac{VDS} on the given route and direction whose cross street name most closely
matches that given in the log using a trigram indexing method to identify
similarity.

For events after mid-2009, the activity log database contains the \ac{iCAD} data
corresponding to the event in question, and in particular, it contains the
\ac{iCAD} geocode which helps locate the incident.  If such a geocode exists,
the above database query is modified to bound the result to \ac{VDS} within 1.5
miles of the geocoded location.

Once these objects are created, they are processed through the
incident impact and \ac{TMCPE} impact models, which use the second
server to execute analysis jobs---particularly the solving of the
mathematical program in equations~\eqref{eq:bip-formulation} using the
\ac{GAMS} solver.  The current implementation uses a synchronous model
which pushes the generated mathematical program to the solution server
using the \texttt{rsync} protocol, executes the \ac{GAMS} solver on
that data via \texttt{ssh}, transfers the results back using
\texttt{rsync}, and processes those results into the \ac{TMCPE}
application domain objects so that they can be served by the
\ac{TMCPE} web application.


\subsubsection{Web application}
\label{sec:web-app}

The \texttt{grails} web application is deployed on a \ac{CTMLabs}
\texttt{tomcat} server.  The \texttt{grails} application is configured to use
the \ac{TMCPE} application database and the \ac{PeMS} mirror database.  We
emphasize here that the web application is completely disconnected from the raw
activity log database.  

Because some of the data provided by the \ac{TMCPE} application is sensitive,
the web application requires that users authenticate using the \ac{CTMLabs}
\acf{CAS} and its underlying \ac{LDAP} user database.  The system is configured
so that only users belonging to the \texttt{tmcpe} group on the \ac{LDAP} server
have access to the application and its underlying data.  Membership in this
group is limited to District 12 staff and researchers directly affiliated with the
\ac{TMCPE} project.  We will add new users to this group on an as-needed basis
based upon guidance given by District 12 staff.


\subsection{Portability of the TMCPE system}
\label{sec:portability}

\subsubsection{Licensing restrictions}
\label{sec:portability-licensing}

The \ac{TMCPE} system was designed from the beginning to be as portable as
possible.  Where possible, we used open-source off-the-shelf software that runs
on multiple architectures and made an effort to select mature products over
unproven technology.  Table~\ref{tab:software-components} summarize the main
software components used.  Unless noted, all licenses are open source and freely
available for Caltrans use (with proper attribution.)  Not listed in this table
are the \ac{CAS} and \ac{LDAP} systems used for user authentication.  We assume
that any new deployment would need to be integrated with authentications already
in place at the site.  If not, free and open source \ac{CAS} and \ac{LDAP}
implementations are readily available for use.

    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Main software components used in the TMCPE application}
  \label{tab:software-components}
\end{sidewaystable}

The only obvious major licensing barrier to portability is that the \ac{TMCPE}
system currently uses the commercial \ac{GAMS} modeling language and \ac{CPLEX}
solver.  This is a powerful and expensive modeling system that was used
primarily for convenience and speed.  As noted in
section~\ref{sec:incident-impact-service}, however, it would be possible to
develop a custom (and unencumbered) solver that would perform similarly.

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements}
\label{sec:portability-hardware}

Beyond the licensing issues, the system requires 1-5 servers for data storage,
processing, and for serving the web application.  Performance of the system
improves when distributed across multiple servers, but nothing precludes
deploying everything to a single server.  

\subsubsection{Network requirements}
\label{sec:portability-network}

Because the user interface of the \ac{TMCPE} system is a web application, the
server must be on a network accessible to the users.  Note that it is easier to
secure the raw activity log data if the system is spread across several servers
as in the current deployment.  If a new deployment wishes to use \ac{PeMS} data,
then a connection to the \ac{PeMS} \texttt{ftp} server is also necessary.

\subsubsection{Data requirements}
\label{sec:portability-data}

As discussed above, the external data required for the \ac{TMCPE} application
include (current sources in parentheses):
\begin{itemize}
\item Current and historical 5-minute \ac{VDS} speed and volume data (\ac{PeMS})
\item Geocoded \ac{TMC} activity data with critical events labeled per
  chapter~\ref{chap:tmc-activity} (District 12 activity log, \ac{iCAD})
\item Map image tiles (for the user interface) (Any tile server compatible with
  OpenLayers; currently using OpenStreetMap data)
\end{itemize}
In theory, the \ac{TMCPE} application is data agnostic as long as the
data sources can be mapped onto this input requirements.  For the
\ac{VDS} data and the tiled map data, there are likely many available
choices that would be suitable.  To date, however, we know of no other
\ac{TMC} activity logging application that would meet the activity
data requirements.  It is probable that Caltrans efforts to develop
\ac{TMCAL} will be compatible or could be made compatible with
relative ease.

\subsubsection{Steps to porting the application}
\label{sec:portability-general}

The following summarizes the anticipated steps to port the \ac{TMCPE} application.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Confirm availability of \ac{VDS}, activity log, and map tile data.
\item Obtain deployment server(s).
\item Allocate logical components to physical infrastructure.
\item Install all required software from table~\ref{tab:software-components},

\chapter{Representative results}
\label{chap:results}

In this chapter we discuss representative results from the \ac{TMCPE} system.
The system went live as a beta in September of 2010 with incidents processed
from January 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2007.  The system will continue to process
new incident data nightly using the \ac{CTMLabs} infrastructure.  In the
following sections, we discuss the characteristics of the data and what they
imply for incident performance.

\section{General statistics}
\label{sec:general-stats}

At the time of writing, the \ac{TMCPE} system had processed a total of $15,135$
events recorded by the District 12 \ac{TMC} between January 1\textsuperscript{st},
2007 and December 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2010.  The general statistics are shown
in table~\ref{tab:anal-inc}.  The events are broken down into various types
according to the classification given to the event in the activity log entry.

  \end{tabularx}
\caption{Characteristics of analyzed incidents}
\label{tab:anal-inc}
\end{table}

The most common type are general \texttt{incidents}.  The common characteristic
of these incidents are that their \ac{iCAD} ID in the system was assigned by the
\ac{iCAD} system rather than in the \ac{TMC}.  This generally means that they
are disruptions to the system for which no planning has taken place, which
include accidents, medical emergencies, and other capacity reducing
events---including most Sigalerts in the database.  As such, the severity of
this class of event (in terms of average $\unit{veh-hr}$ of delay) is higher
than any other.

The remaining analyzed entries include special events at Angel Stadium and the
Honda Center---both in Anaheim---which have active pre-planned traffic
management.  We see lower levels of average delay associated with these events,
which are in proportion to their impact on the system (in particular, attendance
at Angel Stadium events is typically higher than Honda Center events).

The other major class of events are construction and maintenance events that are
similarly planned, but usually occur overnight during periods of low demand and
therefore have a relatively small impact on the system in terms of delay.

The \texttt{emergency} category comes from a legacy \ac{iCAD} ID type that
should be classified as a general incident.  The final \texttt{unknown} category
reflects \ac{iCAD} IDs that weren't readily classifiable based upon the
information available.  Most of these events are likely general incidents as
well.

The data shows that roughly 15\% of the incidents in the database were analyzed,
which is a relatively small number.  Breaking it down by type, however, we see
that about one third of the general incidents have been processed
($\frac{1,933}{5,909}\approx{}33\%$) while very few of the construction and maintenance
events have been ($\frac{101+24}{6,110+258} \approx 2\%$).  There are several
reasons for these relatively low numbers.  

The first is that for the system to perform an analysis, it must be able to
identify the incident location.  As noted earlier in
section~\ref{sec:incident-processing}, prior to the middle of 2009, the only
source of location information available to the system was to parse the activity
log strings to try to identify the route, direction, and location (e.g., nearest
ramp) recorded for the incident.  The general success rate for our parsing
algorithm is approximately $50\%$, with the remainder missed due primarily to
syntax and spelling variations.  Those events whose locations could not be
determined are left unprocessed until the algorithm can be fine-tuned or their
locations are manually identified.

The second major reason that no processing occurs is if there is no evidence of
an impact to the system.  This can occur if:
\begin{itemize}
\item there is no valid data for the estimated time-space region bounds for the event,
\item there is insufficient valid historical data to generate the expected speed
  distribution for the time-space region bounds for the event, and/or
\item no measured speeds in the region indicate a disruption to the system (and
  therefore there is no impact on the system.)
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item range of incident severity
\item compare to D35
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison to conventional delay calculation}
\label{sec:compare-conv}

A major component of the \ac{TMCPE} application is the delay calculation.  The
current method used by Caltrans computes delay as the total travel time added
for vehicles traveling under \fixme[$35\unitfrac{mi}{h}$]{crindt}{refer to the
  original equation}.  We refer to this delay calculation as $D_{35}$.  By
definition, this method implies there is no delay if the average speed on the
roadway is $35\unitfrac{mi}{h}$ or greater.

By contrast, the delay calculation method used in this research,
$D_{TMCPE}$ treats delay as travel time above and beyond
\emph{average} conditions for the given stretch of road for that
time-of-day and day-of-week.  Consequently, it will attribute delays
to incidents that, for instance, slow prevailing traffic from a mean
value of $70\unitfrac{mi}{h}$ down to $35\unitfrac{mi}{h}$ where the
conventional method will not attribute any delay to these conditions.
This will tend to increase the new delay values compared to the
original method.

The use of mean speeds to determine the baseline conditions (instead of
$35\unitfrac{mi}{h}$) also means that if an incident occurs in a typically
congested area with mean speeds below $35\unitfrac{mi}{h}$, then the new method
will attribute lower delays to an incident than the $D_{35}$ method for the same
time-space region.

Finally, the conventional delay calculation method uses analyst-determined
time-space boundaries for the incident impact while the new method determines
them empirically.  We speculate that analysts will tend to select a larger
time-space region than the new method, though we cannot be certain.  If this is
true, then this will tend to reduce the new delay values compared to the
original method.

The net effects of these factors on the final delay values computed for an
incident will vary with the characteristics of the incident.  Empirically,
however, we have seen generally higher delay values using the new method versus
the original method.  For instance, for the 610 incidents evaluated for 2010,
the computed delays by the respective methods are:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    D_{35}   & = 145,680\:\unit{veh\cdot{}hr} \\
    D_{TMCPE} & = 183,987\:\unit{veh\cdot{}hr}
\end{eqnarray*}
This is a 26\% increase in the computed delay compared to the conventional
method.  The discrepancy between these two methods should be taken into
consideration when comparing delay numbers computed using other systems, such as
\ac{PeMS}.

\chapter{Conclusion and Recommendations}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This research project developed a web-based \ac{TMCPE} application that
addresses the problem of identifying the value of the \ac{TMC} in managing
disruptions to the transporation system.  To achieve this goal, the research
team wanted a method that:
\begin{itemize}
\item used available datasources,
\item made direct inferences from available data without the use of simulation,
  and
\item could be converted directly into dollar values.
\end{itemize}

Though a range of techniques are available for valuing the \ac{TMC}, the
research team focused quantifying the delay savings that can be attributed
directly to \ac{TMC} actions.  Using event data from \ac{TMC} activity logs and
traffic state data from the \ac{PeMS} database, the technique determines the
time-space region impacted by each event.  Using these results, the system
estimates the baseline delay for these events as well the impact that the
\ac{TMC} has on reducing delay by computing the delay implications of removing
particular logged \ac{TMC} actions from an incident response.

Given these calculations, the system allows \ac{TMC} managers to evaluate the
performance of various bundles of \ac{TMC} technologies and operational policies
by mapping their effects onto events in the system that can be measured using
existing surveillance systems and daily activity logs.  

The system is deployed on the \ac{CTMLabs} website with a query interface that
allows the analyst to select specific incidents or a range of them.  The web
interface is ready for general use by authenticated \ac{CTMLabs} users.

Looking ahead, we offer the following recommendations for continuing the
development of the \ac{TMCPE} application.  

\paragraph{TMC impact model improvements}

First, we recommend continued development and fine-tuning of the TMC Impact
model that estimates savings attributable to the \ac{TMC}.  The current
technique could be improved to make better use of activity logging data to
relate \ac{TMC} actions to possible changes in the performance of the system.  

Second, we explored alternative statistical techniques that
%research described in section~\ref{sec:alt-tmc-meth} 
offer an alternative and more robust approach to determining which time-space
sections are impacted by external disruptions.  These data-mining methods
% developed in this research
are currently too computationally intensive to be included in the live website,
but the techniques show promise for later deployment as the algorithms are
optimized.

Third, many benefits offered by the \ac{TMC} are not currently
included in this tool.  These include the many direct and indirect
benefits attributable to information dissemination.  We recommend
continued work on enhancements to the \ac{TMC} impact model to
consider diversionary effects due to such information.

Fourth, the system is currently limited to analyzing incidents managed
by Caltrans District 12.  This is solely due to the system's reliance
on the augmented data now available from District 12 activity log due
to improvements made in support of this project.  The methods used,
however, are completely transferable to any system with similar
activity logging data and speed and volume estimates for impacted
sections.  Because the \ac{TMCAL} system currently being deployed by
Caltrans appears to be a developing standard for recording \ac{TMC}
actions, we recommend that the \ac{TMCPE} system be augmented to
accept data from the \ac{TMCAL} data source as well as its current
District 12 activity log backend.

Finally, because the site is integrated into the \ac{CTMLabs}
architecture, the \ac{CTMLabs} team can continue to support and
improve the system as directed by Caltrans users making use of the
system for analysis and reporting tasks.  We believe this development
and support model will continue to improve the system into a
potentially invaluable tool for Caltrans operations and management.
