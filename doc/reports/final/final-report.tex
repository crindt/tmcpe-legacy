\chapter{Introduction and Background}
\label{sec:intro}


Caltrans has a significant investment in TMCs throughout the
state. These operations centers are tasked with maintaining the safety
and efficiency of California's highways by actively managing
disruptions to the system caused by anticipated and unanticipated
events that impact the available capacity and/or the demand to use
individual facilities.  Presently, however, no comprehensive methods
are available to quantify the benefits of existing TMC
deployments. This ongoing research project is developing a TMC
performance evaluation system that addresses this problem. The system
will allow TMC managers to evaluate the performance of various bundles
of TMC technologies and operational policies by mapping their effects
onto events in the system that can be measured using existing
surveillance systems and daily activity logs. The resulting tool will
provide managers with the long needed capabilities to:
\begin{itemize}
\item justify valuable technology, personnel allocations, and
  maintenance costs,
\item identify technologies that aren't meeting their initial promise,
  and
\item identify gaps in current operational strategies that might be
  filled with new technology deployments.
\end{itemize}
The evaluation method used will primarily consider delay savings that
are attributable to specific TMC actions, but may also seek to
quantify benefits on other dimensions such as safety. All computations
are based on direct measurement of the system using available sensors
and do not rely on speculative simulation models requiring extensive
assumptions.

The system is being implemented using a modular software architecture
that can interface with a variety of existing or planned systems used
by Caltrans. The initial deployment is focusing on delivering a
reporting system accessible from the Testbed Website. Possible future
deployments could integrate the core performance evaluation models
with real-time TMC management systems to assist operators with
prioritizing response.

% This report details progress made to date in this project.
% Chapter~\ref{sec:background} describes the general TMC performance
% evaluation problem along with a review of related research and
% recommendations from the literature. 


%\chapter{Background}
%\label{sec:background}

\section{Performance measures of highway systems}
\label{sec:perf-hw-sys}

Recent years have seen a significant push toward better evaluation of
highway systems using data-driven performance measures. A number of
recent federally-sponsored reports offer comprehensive overviews of
current performance monitoring approaches and recommended practice for
transportation management agencies. A common theme of developing an
effective performance measurement system for operations is an early
and complete definition of the goals of the traffic management
system. These goals structure specific efforts in defining performance
measurement tasks and applying the results to improve operations. Once
system goals are defined, they must be translated into metrics that
are obtainable from available (or feasible) data collection systems.
Finally, the metrics should be integrated into management and
operations to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of the system
and, ideally, use that feedback across various time-scales to improve
performance over time. In the next section, we discuss how to apply
this general method to the analysis of TMC performance.

\section{Benefits of the TMC}
\label{sec:tmc-bene}

Traffic management centers perform a range of functions to meet broad
transportation management goals. We use the taxonomy offered by Park (2005) to
characterize TMC functions into three general areas: traffic monitoring, travel
information, and event management.

\subsection{Traffic monitoring}
\label{sec:traf-mon}

Traffic monitoring includes functions where transportation systems must be
monitored in real-time, such as traffic flow monitoring and evaluating traffic
conditions. To date, Caltrans has made significant progress in traffic
monitoring. Data from the state's sensor network is available within and across
districts---notably through PeMS, which offers system-wide measures of
effectiveness on traffic flow as well as the health of the sensor system itself.

\subsection{Travel information}
\label{sec:trav-info}

Travel information programs refer to programs available to the public that
provide information on current traveling conditions. In California, a number of
systems disseminate travel information to the traveling public through various
public channels (traditional media, 511 systems, changeable message signs,
traffic web sites, etc.) so that they can make more informed travel decisions.

Metrics on the benefits of this information dissemination are generally not
available except in vary broad terms from the results of travel behavior surveys
in response to information. Understanding more clearly how travelers respond to
specific information provided by the TMC could identify critical contributions
of TMC operations that heretofore are undervalued.

\subsection{Event management}
\label{sec:event-man}

Events managed by the TMC may be
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item random (e.g., incidents),
\item recurring (e.g., congestion from prevailing traffic patterns)
  and
\item scheduled (maintenance or special events).
\end{inparaenum}
Generally, such events can impact the normal operating capacity of the system or
can produce significantly altered demands.  Event management---particularly of
non-recurrent congestion caused by incidents---is likely the most tangible
benefit offered by the TMC. Procedures vary across districts and are tuned to
the specific capabilities of each, but urban districts with TMCs have
specialists who actively manage disruptions to the system. Nonetheless, event
management is an area of continued development for Caltrans.

The typical metric for evaluating TMC event management processes is delay
savings. A number of methods have been proposed to estimate total non-recurrent
congestion delay.  They can be classified into three groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item analytical methods using deterministic queuing diagrams
  \protect\citep[e.g.,]{goolsby71:_influen_of_incid_freew_qualit_of_servic,chow74:_study_of_traff_perfor_model,morales87:_analy_proced_for_estim_freew_traff_conges,trb94:_highw_capac_manual,lawson97:_using_input_output_diagr_to,erera98:_simpl_gener_method_for_analy,skabardonis04:_devel_and_applic_of_method}
\item kinematic wave (i.e., shockwave) theory \citep[e.g.,]{chow74:_study_of_traff_perfor_model,wirasinghe78:_deter_of_traff_delay_from,heydecker94:_incid_and_inter_freew,al-deek95:_new_method_for_estim_freew_incid_conges}
\item heuristic methods \citep[e.g.,]{skabardonis96:_i_field_exper,skabardonis03:_measur_recur_and_nonrec_traff_conges}
\end{enumerate}
The results from these approaches have been applied both alone and in concert
with each other. But, since virtually none of these studies uses a source of
incident data with descriptive variables and reporting techniques in common with
the others, comparisons between different methods are difficult
\citep{goolsby71:_influen_of_incid_freew_qualit_of_servic}, and their spatial
transferability is limited. To date there has been only limited research into
models that can estimate how long, how far, and to what extent any particular
incident will affect traffic and, by extension, little research into
understanding how TMCs perform at minimizing the impact of such incidents.  The
focus in this project has been the development of incident-specific
delay-estimation metrics that can be used to evaluate TMC performance.
% The next section
% details the methods developed to date and suggests an approach for
% applying these delay metrics to analyzing the impacts of TMC processes
% on incident-related delay.


\section{Data sources}
\label{sec:data-sources}

Performance evaluation requires data.  Specifically, data is needed about what
is happening in the freeway system and data is needed about actions taken by the
TMC and other agencies.  In its role as an information broker for Caltrans, the
TMC has access to a range of information that can meet these needs in whole or
part.  We summarize them in the below as they dictate the types of performance
evaulation analyses that are possible

\subsection{System data}
\label{sec:system-data}

The real-time traffic data collected by Caltrans loop detectors stations are the
primary source of information regarding the actual performance of the freeway
system during incidents. A number of sources supply this data in a manner that
can be used for this project.  It should be noted, however, that a local archive
of the data must be maintained as the delay calculations rely on customized
queries for relevant sensor data.  These queries are not generally available
from the systems listed below.

\subsubsection{PeMS}
\label{sec:pems}

Initial prototype of the TMC performance evaluation system used the PeMS
database to obtain a year of 5-minute data from every sensor in Orange County.
This data was archived in a local database to support the prototyping of
efficient database queries necessary for the analysis.  PeMS offers availability
to this data archive that is scriptable and therefore could be incorporated as
the primary data source for archived performance in the system.

\subsubsection{ATMS/UCI sensor archive}
\label{sec:uci-data}


The UCI Testbed provides an ideal implementation platform for accessing detector
data because the UCI Testbed labs receive identical data to that available to in
the TMC by way of the Testbed real-time data intertie and the associated
database.  As such, development can proceed in the UCI labs and later be
transferred seamlessly to operation in D12.

\subsubsection{D12 SOAP interface (devices)}
\label{sec:d12-soap}

For greater transferability of the performance evaluation system, the
performance evaluation system can also make use of the devices implementation in
the District 12's SOAP interface.  This interface implements portions of the
center-to-center interface of the National ITS Architecture standard---including
the VDS interface standard which streams 30-second sensor readings from all
detectors in the district.  In order to make use of this interface, the
performance evaluation system would need to build its own archive of sensor data
received.

\subsection{TMC actions}
\label{sec:tmc-actions}


\subsubsection{TMC activity log}

At present, the D12 TMC activity log records a range of transactions---actions
carried out by TMC operators that they manually record using a web-based
interface to the log database.  Transactions in the database are cross
referenced with CHP CAD ids, which allows additional data from the CAD
system---such as the incident's geographic coordinates---to be associated with
each incident under analysis.  Currently, only a limited number of database
entries are reliable enough to parse automatically and thus be used directly by
the performance evaluation system.  These are the \texttt{OPEN/CLOSE INCIDENT}
and \texttt{SIGALERT BEGIN/END} entries.  Additional entries relating to the
status of changeable message signs and construction closures are useful for
cross checking, but generally cannot be used in the calculations described in
chapter~\ref{sec:method} in their present form.  Improvements to the TMC
activity log are planned for the remainder of this contract.


\subsubsection{CHP CAD log (XML feed)}

The CHP Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) system logs all roadway incident reports
including: incident date, CHP CAD identification number, CHP CAD time stamp,
incident type, and incident location. This data is not necessarily canonical and
therefore is not necessarily easy to parse automatically. Nonetheless, it is the
only source for raw information regarding multi-agency incident response.

The functions provided by the TMC performance evaluation project require a local
copy of the key data from the CHP CAD log---particularly the geographic location
of incidents.  To support this requirement, the CHP CAD log will be locally
archived as part of this project.  If the geographic data is added to the
Activity Log, the direct dependence of the performance evaluation system on the
CHP CAD log can be removed.

\subsubsection{D12 SOAP interface (events, devices)}

The D12 SOAP interface also streams event data from the TMC and control states
of Changable Message Signs and Ramp Metering Stations.  The event data could be
tapped to obtain incident verification details, while the CMS and RMS settings
could be parsed to infer control actions carried out by operators.  Ideally,
however, any control actions would be tied to specific TMC processes and their
associated goals (see section 6 for further discussion on relating actions to
TMC processes).

\section{Organization of this report}
\label{sec:organization}


The remainder of this report is structured as follows.
Chapter~\ref{chap:tmc-activity} describes the processes used in the Caltrans D12
TMC during the management of accidents, which is the initial target of this
performance evaulation effort.  Chapter~\ref{sec:method} details the methods
being used for performance measurement---with a focus on the calculation of
delay attributable to specific incidents as well as a discussion of how to model
the impacts of TMC actions on the dynamics of such incidents.
%Section \ref{} offers a preliminary
%analysis of three representative incidents used to evaluate the
%method. 
Chapter~\ref{sec:system-architecture} describes the system architecture that is
being developed to deploy the system as an operational tool for the TMC as part
of the Caltrans ATMS Testbed.
%Finally, section \ref{} offers some recommendations for
%modifications to existing processes and tools in the District 12 TMC
%(particularly the TMC activity log) that will support more complete
%performance evaluation metrics going forward.

\chapter{TMC Activity}
\label{chap:tmc-activity}

At the onset of this project, the district 12 TMC employed locally-developed
software to record TMC activity.  This software was developed over a number of
years with a variety of purposes in mind.  Though the initial analyses have been
conducted using this existing logging data, the data is unsuitable for general
purpose automated processing to identify critical events in TMC operations that
impact system performance.  As such, work was initiated under this contract to
improve the activity logging system to better meet such performance monitoring
needs going forward.

A critical first step in this process has been the identification of core events
in incident management that can be directly recorded by the activity logging
system through a set of interviews and communications with district 12 staff and
contractors.  The following summarizes the TMC processes used to manage
accidents occuring in the managed system.  Note that this effort was carried out
in parallel to a number of efforts in district 12 and beyond to capture and
organize event management, including D12's event management system development
and the Caltrans-wide effort to develop the TMCAL logging system.  Any findings
below should be considered one characterization of the larger problem of
organizing TMC processes to best manage, monitor, and evaluate Caltrans traffic
management in general, and TMC activity in particular.

Based upon our interviews, incident management by the TMC can be described as
four major subprocesses that are traversed sequentially as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}
\begin{sidewaysfigure}
  \pgfpagesuselayout{resize to}[letterpaper,landscape,border shrink=5mm]
  \centering
  \input{figs/process-flowchart-2.tikz}
  \caption[TMC process flowchart for accident management]{TMC process
    flowchart for accident management.  Four major subprocesses
    dictate a series of actions to be carried out by the TMC.  The
    trajectory through the subprocesses is governed by a series of
    events (in red) whose dynamics are dictated by events in the
    field.}
  \label{fig:flowchart}
\end{sidewaysfigure}
Each subprocess dictates a series of actions to be carried out by the TMC.  The
transition between the subprocesses is governed by a series of events (in red)
whose dynamics are dictated by events in the field.

\section{Identification}
\label{sec:identification}


TMC management of an incident always begins with the {\sc First Call} to the
TMC, which notifies operators that there has been a disruption to what is
considered ``normal'' operating conditions.  From an operational perspective,
these disruptions can affect the capacity of particular sections of roadway (as
in a traffic accident), the prevailing demand to use particular stretches of
roadway (as in a special event), or some combination of the two.  Our emphasis
for the current discussion is capacity-reducing accidents.

The {\sc First Call} can come from any number of sources including:
\begin{itemize}
\item CHP CAD
\item ATMS Map
\item Caltrans field units
\item Public---via phone
\item CCTV
\item Media
\item Neighboring districts
\end{itemize}
The vast majority come by way of the CHP CAD system and the local CHP liason to
the TMC.

When a {\sc First Call} is received, initial details are collected about the
location, type, and likely impact on the system.  TMC staff is notified and a
decision is made to manage the incident, which we term an {\sc Open Incident}
event, at which point the process transitions to the Verification stage.


\section{Verification}
\label{sec:verification}

The purpose of verification is to identify and confirm the details of the
incident to support response including the location, type, severity, and any
other special conditions that are necessary to support TMC operations.  Strictly
speaking, the TMC cannot respond to the incident until its characteristics are
known.  This is particularly true in situations requiring special response, such
as incidents requiring hazardous material spills.  Since total queuing delay is
proportional to the fourth power of the response time (see
section~\ref{sec:total-delay}), the speed with which verification is carried out
can be a significant determinant to the quality of the response and the
subsequent degree of disruption experienced by users of the system.

The TMC has a number of resources to support verification including:
\begin{itemize}
\item CCTV (both those owned by Caltrans and those owned by partner
  agencies)
\item CHP field units
\item Caltrans field units
\end{itemize}
TMC operators use information collected via resources to characterize the
incident---which we term a diagnosis---for the purpose of formulating a
response.  Once a diagnosis is produced, verification is complete and the TMC
moves to the {\sc Response} subprocess.

\section{Response}
\label{sec:response}

The response subprocess is understandably the most involved activity carried out
by the TMC.  The collection of activities carried fall into four categories:
Information dissemination, Field Response, Coordination, and Control.

\subsection{Information dissemination}
\label{sec:inf-dis}

The sharing of information regarding the incident is one of the most critical
actions carried out by the TMC.  Information must flow to a number of audiences.
Among the most important recipients are the operators and management of other
agencies---including neighboring Caltrans districts and management, whose
actions may depend on or involve the affected facilities.  Dedicated procedures
exist for providing this communication, and for specifying when such
communication must occur.  For instance, headquarters is always notified when a
SIGALERT is issued, updated, and terminated.

Similarly, the users of the system must be notified of disruptions.  This serves
the purpose of providing both higher quality of service to users, since lack of
information degrades the user experience, as well as acting as a control
mechanism to initiate unmanaged diversion (see below for prescribed diversion).
A number of communications channels exist for notifying the public.  The media
is informed through various information feeds that are provided directly or
indirectly by Caltrans and its partner agencies.  For instance, members of the
media can access the public CHP CAD feed as well as speed information derived
from Caltrans freeway sensors and exposed to various traffic information
providers by via the ATMS system.  Issuance of a SIGALERT (by the CHP) or a
Traffic Advisory (by Caltrans) triggers specific interactions with the media.
Information can be provided directly to users in the vicinity of the incident
using the fixed or mobile CMS and HAR systems.

\subsection{Field response}
\label{sec:field-response}

The field response to a particular incident is governed by the diagnosis
generated during the {\sc Verification} process.  The Caltrans TMC is
responsible for managing the actions of traffic management teams (TMTs),
hazardous material crews (HAZMAT), maintenance crews, and the coroner (managed
by the CHP) that are dispatched to mitigate the impacts of an incident on
traffic operations and system infrastructure.  These actions are critical to
restoring the performance of the system to normal and are therefore time
critical events that must be logged effectively to support performance
evaulation.

\subsection{Coordinate}
\label{sec:coordinate}

Though the transportation system is divided into multiple jurisdictions for
management purposes, its global performance is linked by the actions of other
agencies, most notably the CHP, neighboring Caltrans districts, and neighboring
municipalities.  From interviews with TMC staff, coordination with CHP is fluid,
with the CHP and the TMC working in concert to manage incidents.  Coordination
with neighboring districts also involves fluid communications regarding actions
and responsibilities.  Coordination with municipal entities is limited except in
the case of severe incidents.  In those instances, response coordination is
typically governed by pre-defined coordinated response plans that govern
actions, for instance, in the case of a freeway closure and subsequent diversion
to a municipality's surface street network.


\subsection{Control}
\label{sec:control}

Active traffic control actions taken by Caltrans are typically limited to the
most severe incidents.  In those cases, Caltrans may institute a freeway closure
and prescribed diversion.  In very rare instances involving long-term closures,
settings of field traffic controllers (such as time-of-day ramp metering
settings) may be modified to account for shifts in prevailing traffic flow.


\section{Monitoring}
\label{sec:monitoring}

Each discrete response activity described above has an explicit or implicit
intended outcome that would, in an ideal system, be directly measurable via the
monitoring subprocess.  In reality, the impact of only a subset of the response
actions can be measured directly.  For instance, the efforts of CHP, TMT,
etc. to clear the roadway can be recorded directly in the TMC activity logs as
lanes restored.  The impact of information dissemination, on the other hand, is
very difficult to infer from the course sensor data available.  The monitoring
process should also track when additional event(s) occur that may impact the
mitigation efforts for a prevailing incident.  Management of multiple incidents
may be handled separately or combined into a single management problem.

Generally, the monitoring process should keep track of changes to the system as
they relate to the incident in question.  Changes might include arrival of TMT
or other response crews, lane clearance, completion of HAZMAT efforts, length of
queuing (for validation purposes) and any other information that is potentially
relevant to incident post analysis.  Each such (verified) {\sc Status Change}
could produce an updated diagnosis and possibly changes to the TMC response, as
indicated by the feedback loop in figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}.


\section{Practical Concerns}
\label{sec:practical-concerns}

The TMC is a complex environment with a vast array of hardware and software
collecting, managing, and disseminating information regarding the performance
and operation of the Caltrans highway network.  It is notable that a number of
these systems have functions that occasionally overlap.  For instance, the
activity logging software is the \emph{de facto} interface for TMC operators
engaged in traffic management.  However, a subset of TMC actions, like setting
the CMS messages are carried out via the ATMS system.  Logging of CMS messages
in the activity log must (currently) be done manually.  Furthermore, Caltrans
continues to actively develop an expert system for event management to improve
event management processes by formalizing them and mandating that certain
information is recorded and that particular actions are carried out.

In this complex environment, additional logging burdens are not likely to be
well received.  Ideally, many TMC actions would be automatically logged using
messages passed between the various software systems (including the TMC activity
log interface) to a logging service that maintains the backend logging database.
With this in mind, we recommend a simple, extensible event tagging system that
captures key points of the incident management process consistent with the above
description.  These event tags correspond to the red events in
figure~\ref{fig:flowchart} and are summarized in
table~\ref{tab:tmc-event-summary}.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
 \footnotesize
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
  \hline
  \textbf{Event tag} & \textbf{Description}\\
  \hline {\sc \textcolor{red}{First Call}} & Logged when a TMC
  operator received the first report of an incident.  Typically will
  be the first entry in the activity log with an associated CHP CAD ID
  and should note the source of the notification.  \\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Open Incident}} & Logged when the decision is
  made that a particular incident must be tracked and
  managed by the TMC.\\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Verify Incident}} & Logged when the details of
  the incident have been confirmed.  Should include all sources (and
  technology) used to verify the characteristics of the incident.  \\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Response Action:<Subtype>}} & Logged when a
  particular action is taken to mitigate the impact of an incident.
  The range of actions available for logging will vary with the
  situation.\\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Status Change:<Subtype>}} & Logged when a
  notable change to the managed event has occurred.  For instance,
  arrival of TMT, restoration of a lane, etc.  Informational messages
  for model validation are useful here too, such as noting the
  location of the back of the queue.\\
  {\sc \textcolor{red}{Close Incident}} & Logged when all management
  functions have terminated and traffic flow has returned to normal
  conditions. \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
  \caption{Core TMC events to be recorded by the activity log to support TMC performance evaulation}
  \label{tab:tmc-event-summary}
\end{table}

The {\sc Response Action} and {\sc Status Change} tags will ideally include a
complete set of possible response/condition pairs that characterizes TMC actions
and their effects.  To the exent that the TMC Logging system can standardize
logging to produce unambiguous tags for these events, the performance evaluation
system will be able to reconstruct historical incidents for post-analysis.  The
next chapter describes that modeling methodology as it current stands, and
points to the next steps for completing the performance evaluation system.


\chapter{Modeling Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

To determine the relative impact of TMC technologies and processes on the
performance of the system, we decompose the analysis into two general steps.  In
the first step, an \emph{incident impact model}
(section~\ref{sec:incident-impact-model}) estimates the degree to which an
incident disrupts freeway operations in time and space (the ``control volume'')
as well as the total delay in the control volume using sensor observations
relative to ``average'' conditions.  This delay estimate serves as a baseline
condition for the analysis.  In the second phase of the analysis, we use the
\emph{TMC impact model} (section~\ref{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}) to explore how
system performance would change in the absence of specific TMC actions by
coupling observations and estimated changes in critical incident parameters with
a model based upon queuing theory to estimate delays for the same incident if
the TMC was absent.


\section{Incident impact model}
\label{sec:incident-impact-model}

\subsection{Section definition}
\label{sec:sec-def}
A freeway section in this study corresponds to a mainline loop detector
station. Section boundaries are defined by the middle of two detector stations
as shown in figure~\ref{fig:sec-def}.  We assume that estimated speed at the
station is representative of the speed for the corresponding section.  Based on
the sections and their corresponding detector stations, estimated speeds and
densities for each section i are calculated for each 5-minute interval during
the one-year analysis period---sections downstream of section i are labeled
consecutively as $(i + 1), (i + 2), \ldots{}$ while those upstream are labeled
consecutively as $(i - 1), (i - 2), \ldots{}$.
\begin{figure}[t]%
  \begin{center}%
    \inputTikZ{figs/standard-freeway-sectioning}%
    \caption[Section definition and corresponding detector
    location]{Section definition and corresponding detector location.
      Sections boundaries are formed by bisecting freeway segments between
      each pair of detectors.  By convention, section numbers increase as
      you move downstream. }
    \label{fig:sec-def}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Stream state estimation using single loops}
\label{sec:state-est}

This method relies upon access to the prior one-year of historical traffic
data--- specifically: traffic counts and occupancy for each lane at each
detector station every 30 seconds. Lane-by-lane traffic data is aggregated to
5-minute intervals at each detector station in order to obtain stable traffic
data from each point.

Loop detectors in Orange County predominantly are single loop detectors that
provide only traffic counts and occupancies; travel speeds need to be estimated
from these measures assuming a so-called ``$g$-factor,'' the summation of the
average vehicle length and effective detection length
\cite{hall89:_evaluat_of_speed_estim_made,jia01:_pems_algor_for_accur_real,wang03:_can_singl_loop_detec_do}.
The average speed, $\overline{s}$ , can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:speed-est}
  \overline{s} (\unitfrac{mi}{h}) = g\left(\frac{q}{5280(\unitfrac{ft}{mi}) \times occ}\right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[$q$] = $\textrm{flow rate} (\unitfrac{veh}{h})$
\item[$occ$] = $\textrm{vehicle occupancy} (\%)$
\item[$g$]= $\textrm{$g$-factor}$ 
\end{description}
\end{quote}
Applying appropriate $g$-factors is a key in estimating speeds from single loop
detector data. There are various ways to estimate $g$-factors.  The simplest
approach is to use a single $g$-factor for all loop detectors in the study area.
Although this is very common in practice, the approximation from this approach
is too coarse for the objective of this study.  An alternative is to use a
single $g$-factor for each lane through the entire freeway system.  This
approach accounts for vehicle length varying by lane, but assumes the same
proportion of heavy vehicles on every section of the freeway.  Another approach
is to find a single $g$-factor for every loop in each lane.  This can be
estimated by using flow and occupancy from some period for which speed can be
assumed to be known; for example, flow and occupancy during 1:00AM-1:05AM, where
the average speed can be assumed as a free flow speed, can be used to calculate
the $g$-factor.  This approach, however, does not account for the variation of
the vehicle composition over time.  \citet{jia01:_pems_algor_for_accur_real}
noted that the $g$-factors for different loop detectors in the same district
differ by as much as 100 percent, and the $g$-factors for the same loop can vary
up to 50 percent over 24-hour period.

In this research, we account for spatial and temporal variations of the
$g$-factors by calculating a $g$-factor representing each hour interval over the
52 weeks for each loop detector station as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:g-fact}
  \hat{g}_i(t+1) = p\cdot{}\hat{g}_i(t)+(1-p)\cdot{}g_i(t+1)
\end{equation}
\begin{quote}
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\hat{g}_i(t)$] = $g$-factor for section $i$ for time step $t$
  \item[$g_i(t+1)$] = initial average $g$-factor for section $i$ for
    time step $t+1$, obtained by assuming free-flow speed (75 mph)
    when the occupancy is lower than 0.06
  \item[$p$] = smoothing parameter (0.9 in this research)
  \end{description}
\end{quote}
By applying the above procedure, representative $g$-factors for each hour of day
are calculated for all loop detector stations. These $g$-factors provide basic
information for speed calculation in this study. Based on these $g$-factors,
speeds are calculated every 5 minutes for all 52 weeks.

\subsection{Nominal speed distribution}
\label{sec:nom-speed-dist}
For each freeway section j , for each specific 5-minute time interval $t_m$ on
each day of the week, a nominal total of 52 observations1 are available during
the one-year observation period on which to base calculations of flow $q_j(t_m)$
and occupancy $\mathrm{occ}_j(t_m)$ under conditions that are incident free. For
example, section $j$ on Monday from $t_m$ = 08:10 to 08:15 for 52 weeks is
composed of 52 samples. Thus the speed associated with the
$n$\textsuperscript{th} observation for any particular day-of-week/time
interval/section combination can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nominal-speed-obs}
  \overline{s}_{jn}(t_m) = g_{jn}(t_m)\left(\frac{q_{jn}(t_m)}{5280\times occ_{jn}(t_m)}\right);n=1,2,\ldots,K,\ldots{52}
\end{equation}
where the subscript n is used to designate the estimate of the corresponding
value based on the $n$\textsuperscript{th} observation. From these (nominally)
52 observations, a distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$ can be constructed, such as
that shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-case}.  Then, let $\Omega_{jm} =
\Omega\left(\overline{s}_j(t_m),\sigma_{s_j}(t_m)\right)$ denote the set of
parameters defining the distribution of speeds $s_{jn}(t_m)$ corresponding to
this ``incident-free'' base case. (Here, we make no attempt to categorize these
distributions among the set of well-known distributions, but rather assume, for
simplicity, that they can be adequately defined by their means and standard
deviations.)  Then, associated with an incident known to have occurred on
freeway section $i$ during some time interval $t_1$ , we can compose a matrix of
the parameters defining the distribution of base case conditions (i.e.,
conditions in which there is no incident) that can be expected to prevail for
$t_m \ge t_1, m = 1, 2, \ldots{}, M$ (i.e., time intervals after the incident
that occurs in section i at t1 ) for all upstream sections that could possibly
have been affected by the incident, as in figure~\ref{tab:speed-base-case-dist}.

Similarly, associated with a known incident that occurs on freeway section $i$
at time $t = t1$, we can construct a matrix of speeds $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ based on
observed loop data under the incident conditions, $ \hat{q}_j(t_m),
\hat{k}_j(t_m); j=i,i-1,i-2,\ldots{},1 ; m = 1,2,\ldots{},M$ as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:shat}
  \hat{s}_j(t_m) = \frac{\hat{q}_j(t_m)}{\hat{k}_j(t_m)}; \: j=i,i-1,i-2,\ldots{},1 ;
m = 1,2,\ldots{},M
\end{equation}
from which we can then compose a matrix of incident case speed conditions (i.e.,
conditions that were observed to prevail following the incident) as in
figure~\ref{tab:speed-base-case-dist}.

Using figure~\ref{tab:speed-base-case-dist}, we can identify the
negative effects (i.e., speed reduction) of the incident schematically
as shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact}.  The negative effect by
the incident will be propagated from the incident section to upstream
sections.  Such a distinct discontinuity between non-congested and
congested flow is known as a shock wave
\cite{lighthill55:_kinem_waves}.  If the dot-shaded (yellow) area
affected by the shock wave in figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact} is
identified, then the temporal and spatial impacts of the incident will
be also determined. 
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic}
    \caption[Incident impact projected into discrete space]{Incident
      impact projected into discrete space.  The state of traffic flow
      is described in terms of discrete spatial ($i$) and temporal ($t$)
      sections as shown.  An incident occurring at the downstream end of
      section $i$ at time $t_1$ disrupts flow for some period of time.
      The geometry of the fastest possible shockwave line dictates that
      the sections above cannot be impacted by the incident (shown in
      gray).  The sections below this line (shown in blue) could
      feasibly be impacted by the incident.  In actuality, only a subset
      of the discrete sections (shown in yellow) will be circumscribed
      by the loading and clearing shockwaves.}
    \label{fig:incident-impact}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
We approach this identification as a topology problem in which the
objective is to construct the most probable set of cells that define
the incident-affected temporal/spatial region, subject to constraints
imposed by allowable shapes of the affected region. The following
section describes the method for discriminating the regions between
non-congested and congested area due to traffic incidents.


\subsection{Quantifying the total delay caused by an incident}
\label{sec:delay-calc}

\subsubsection{Determining maximum extent of incident influence}
\label{sec:max-infl}

Since data on neither the severity (such as the number of closed lanes
by an incident) nor when the incident was cleared are directly
obtainable from loop data, we first estimate the maximum possible
extent of the shock wave by assuming the worst possible
conditions-total blockage for some pre-specified time period. Thus,
for any given incident occurring at section i at time $t_1$ , we
compute the maximum number of upstream sections that could be affected
by the assumed persistent total blockage at section i at time $t_1$
. Using this sort of data, we can schematically construct the
``maximum area of interest'' for any incident occurring at section $i$
at time $t_1$ as the shaded (blue) area in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact}. Based on this interpretation, the
only data relevant to the current example of an incident occurring at
section $i$ at time $t_1$ can be restricted to cells in the shaded
(blue) area. That is, the region of interest can be
depicted as shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact-feas}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic-reduced}
    \caption[Reduced feasible space]{Reduced feasible space.}
    \label{fig:incident-impact-feas}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Determining the congested region}
\label{sec:det-cong-reg}

Figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact-feas} shows two shaded areas: a
dot-shaded (yellow) area and plain-shaded (blue) area. The cells in
the dot-shaded (yellow) area represent speeds, $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$, that
have been determined to have been affected by the incident; i.e., they
have been deemed to be significantly lower than would be expected
based on the distribution of non-incident base speeds for that
particular section-time interval combination.  The plain-shaded (blue)
cells represent particular section-time interval combinations for
which the observed speeds are not significantly different from
non-incident conditions.  That is, they are speeds that are determined
from observation not to be affected by the pertinent incident, but
within the maximum possible affected  sections by an
incident of greatest consequence (when all lanes are blocked, as
assumed above).

Considering that the speed of traffic in sections adversely affected
by the traffic incident will be lowered, the basic idea behind
discriminating between these two regions is to compare the incident
speed, $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$, to the distribution of the non-incident
speeds $s_{jn}(t_m); n = 1,2,\ldots{},n_{obs}; n_{obs}\le 52$ and
assign some level of confidence that any particular $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$
was not drawn from the distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$. If we limit our
level of confidence that the speed was not drawn from the distribution
of $s_{jn}(t_m)$ to those that compute to be at least
$\alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$ , where $\alpha$ is a positive number,
below the mean speed of the distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$, we can
define two cases according the difference between the mean speed and
the threshold as shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-case}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/incident-speed-classification}
    \caption[The method for determining whether observed speeds are
    evidence of abnormal conditions.]{The method for determining whether
      observed speeds are evidence of abnormal conditions.  An observed
      speed distribution for a given freeway section $j$ and time of day
      $m$ is shown (in blue) having a mean $\overline{s}_j(t_m)$ and
      standard deviation $\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$.  When the observed speed
      estimate $\hat{s}_j(m)$ of a section falls below the critical
      threshold $\hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) -
      \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$, the observation is treated as
      evidence that an incident is occurring.  When $\hat{s}_j(t_m) >
      \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}$, the
      observation is treated as evidence of normal conditions.}
    \label{fig:incident-speed-case}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
If, in the representation of figure~\ref{fig:incident-impact-feas}, we
assign to the cells in which speed has been significantly affected by
the incident the outcome of the probability that the speed
$\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ in such cells is drawn from the distribution of speeds
associated with non-incident conditions, we can construct the binary
matrix shown in figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary},
as the ``true'' representation of the affected region.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic-binary}
    \caption[Binary incident speed classification matrix]{Binary incident speed classification matrix.}
    \label{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

However, owing to uncertainties and other externalities, assigning an
outcome based on a significance test related to the null hypothesis
that the cell speed actually came from the non-incident speed
distribution, in general will result in less-than accurate conclusions
regarding the affected region, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary-dirty}, where the
true boundary of the affected region is shown by the red line.

    \caption[Empirical binary incident speed classification
    matrix]{Empirical binary incident speed classification matrix.}
    \label{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary-dirty}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


If we define $P_{jm}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pjm}
  P_{jm} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)},\\
    1;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) > \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
the problem of determining the ``best'' set of ``dot-shaded (or yellow)'' cells can be
formulated as following statement.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:best-as-minimum}
  \sum\limits_{\forall\text{dot shaded cells}} P_{jm} + \sum\limits_{\forall\text{unshaded cells}} (1-P_{jm}) = \text{Minimum}
\end{equation}
Or, defining
\begin{equation*}
  \delta_{jm} =
  \begin{cases}
    1,& \text{if cell is affected by the incident (i.e., dot-shaded)},\\
    0,& \text{if cell is not affected by the incident (i.e., plain shaded)}.
  \end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
Equation~(\ref{eq:best-as-minimum}) can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:best-as-minimum-w-delta}
  \sum\limits_{\forall j,m}\left[P_{jm}\cdot\delta_{jm}+(1-P_{jm})\cdot(1-\delta_{jm})\right] = \text{Minimum}
\end{equation}
In this minimization problem, care must be taken regarding the number
of observations because we use statistics regarding the mean and
standard deviation that would be sensitive to the number of
observations. It must be noted that a relatively high portion of
traffic data cannot be collected due to various reasons, e.g.,
electrical malfunction of detector and temporary freeway maintenance
work. However, when calculating the mean and standard deviation of the
distribution of the non-accident speeds $s_{jn}(t_m); n = 1,
2,\ldots{}, n_{\mathrm{obs}}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \le 52$ and assigning
some level of confidence that any particular $\hat{s}_j(t_m)$ was not
drawn from the distribution of $s_{jn}(t_m)$ , we need a ``sufficient
number'' of observations, $n_{\mathrm{obs}}$.  We first need to set a
threshold regarding the minimum number of observations that we require
in order to have some confidence in the statistical calculations for
mean and standard deviation, say $n_{\textrm{minobs}}$. Since 30 is
commonly used for the minimum number of observations required for the
law of large numbers to apply, we set $n_{\textrm{minobs}} =
30$. Then, for cells in the matrix in
figure~\ref{fig:incident-speed-classification-binary} for which
$n_{\mathrm{obs}} < n_{\textrm{minobs}}$, we set $P_{jm} = 0.5$ and
continue the analysis; i.e., we modify the definition of $P_{jm}$ as
follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pjm-final}
  P_{jm} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) \le \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \ge n_{\textrm{minobs}}\\
    1;& \hat{s}_j(t_m) > \overline{s}_j(t_m) - \alpha\cdot\sigma_{s_j(t_m)}; n_{\mathrm{obs}} \ge n_{\textrm{minobs}}\\
    0.5;& n_{\mathrm{obs}} < n_{\textrm{minobs}}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Moreover, the subset of cells for which the accident speeds are
significantly different from the non-accident speeds comprise a region
that theoretically must obey certain properties. Specifically, there
are three impossible local shape configurations for the subset of
spatio-temporal cells congested by the accident. The first such case
is a region that contains any holes, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-1}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-1}
    \caption[Impossible shape I of the impacted region]{Impossible shape I of the impacted region.}
    \label{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
In addition, the vertical position ($t$) of any dot-shaded
(``yellow'') section $j$ must be either lower or same (i.e., $\le$ )
vertical position of the neighboring shaded (``yellow'') section $j -
n$ , as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-2}.
\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption[Impossible shape II of the impacted region]{Impossible shape II of the impacted region.}
    \label{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
Likewise, figure~\ref{fig:time-space-incident-schematic-infeasible-3}
represents another impermissible configuration.
\begin{figure}[t]

  \end{center}
\end{figure}
These conditions can be enforced by the following relationships:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:constraint-relationships}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:constraint-relationship-a}
    \delta_{j+k,m} &\le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le J - j\\
    \label{eq:constraint-relationship-b}        
    \delta_{j,m+r} & \le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j,m+1})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}r \le M - m\\
    \label{eq:constraint-relationship-c}            
    \delta_{j,m+k} & \le \left[1 + (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le M - m
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $R$ is a large number, $J$ is the maximum number of upstream
sections, and $M$ is the maximum number of time period, in 5-minute
intervals (e.g., if the analysis time period is 4 hours in the study,
$M$ = 48).  Equations~(\ref{eq:best-as-minimum-w-delta}) and
(\ref{eq:constraint-relationships}) are in the form of the objective
function and constraint, respectively, of ``Binary Integer Programming
(BIP).'' The determination problem described above can be represented
in the form of the following BIP problem:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \label{eq:bip-formulation}
  \min\limits_{\delta_{jm}} Z & = \sum\limits_{\forall{}j,m}\left[P_{jm}\cdot{}\delta_{jm}+(1-P_{jm})(1-\delta_{jm})\right] \\
  \textrm{st}~~~~~~~~~&\\
    \delta_{j+k,m} &\le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le J - j\\
    \delta_{j,m+r} & \le \left[1 - (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j,m+1})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}r \le M - m\\
    \delta_{j,m+k} & \le \left[1 + (\delta_{j,m} - \delta_{j+1,m})\right]\cdot{}R; \forall{}j, m; \forall{}k \le M - m
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
In the definition of $P_{jm}$, the threshold value $\alpha$ is very
critical to separate between speed affected by an incident and the
other speeds.  In this study, various values were applied to find the
best threshold. The best value was empirically found from the relation
between traffic data and traffic accident as $\alpha = 0.25$.


\subsection{Ongoing work}
\label{sec:ongoing-work-incident-impact}

\subsubsection{Improved statistical techniques}
\label{sec:improved-stats}

The statistical techniques described in section~\ref{sec:det-cong-reg}
used to determine the evidence that a given time-space freeway segment
is experiencing abnormal conditions is admittedly simple.  We are
currently working with data mining experts to develop a more robust
statistical technique that applies Bayesian methods to develop better
evidence regarding the presence of abnormal conditions on the roadway.
Among the advantages to the approach under development will be the
development of finer grained confidence estimates about incident
conditions ranging from 0 to 1, rather than the current approach that
uses only values in the set {0,0.5,1}, representing certainty of no
incident, complete uncertainty, and certainty of incident.  

We anticipate that the new approach will speed the solution algorithm
and produce better results.  Furthermore, the approach is novel and
should add an important contribution to the literature.


\subsubsection{Improved solver}
\label{sec:improved-solver}

The initial implementation for the proof of concept formulates the
binary integer program (BIP) in equations~(\ref{eq:bip-formulation})
for solution using the \texttt{GAMS} solver, which is a general
purpose solver.  At present, the solution time for determining the
impacted region on a single facility for a major incident is on the
order of 60 seconds.  Since the number of major incidents per day is
relatively small, this performance is suitable for batch processes
that compute the baseline delays for a given day during the course of
the following night.  Still, it is likely that the (time) performance
of the solver can be improved by using algorithms more tuned for
solving BIP problems.  Improved performance would give the analyst
more flexibility for re-running the solver with different parameters
(e.g., $\alpha$, the maximum duration, etc.) for a given incident.
This would, in turn, allow the web-based interface to provide a better
end-user experience.



\section{Modeling {TMC} impacts}
\label{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}

The following details a proposed method for computing transient or
oversaturated queues caused by incident conditions subject to critical
parameters under the influence of TMC operations---particularly the
time to respond to an incident. While it is a work in progress, it
represents the basis of the approach we will use to model the benefits
of the TMC.

We begin by describing the typical capacity-disrupting incident. Let
\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
\item[$A(t)$] = Cumulative quantity (or number of vehicles) to arrive
  by time t.
\item[$D(t)$] = Cumulative quantity (or number of vehicles) to have
  been serviced by time t.
\item[$Q(t)=A(t)-D(t)$] = Number of vehicles in the queue (or queue
  length) at time t.
\end{description}
\end{quote}
Suppose that the arrival rate, queue, and time interval are
sufficiently large so that random fluctuations in the number of
arrivals can be considered small compared to the observed number of
arrivals; i.e., the Law of Large Numbers applies:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lln}
  \Pr\left\{\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{A(t)-E\{A(T)\}}{E\{A(t)\}}\right\} 
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{eq:lln}) implies that $A(t), D(t)$ can be approximated by
non-random continuous variables.

For example, when $Q(0)=1$, and we have a steady arrival rate $\lambda
\Rightarrow A(t) = \lambda t$ , and a constant service rate $\mu \Rightarrow D(t)
= \mu t, Q(t)>0$, then, 
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:arrival-and-queues}
  A(t) & = Q(0) + \lambda t \Rightarrow \lambda = \frac{dA(t)}{dt}\\
  Q(t) & = Q(0) + (\lambda - \mu ) t; \: Q(t) \ge 0
\end{align*}
These conditions are shown in figure~\ref{fig:queuing-constant-rates}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/queuing-undersat-and-oversat}
    \caption[Queuing under constant arrival and service rates]{Queuing
      under constant arrival and service rates.  In both figures, a
      queue of length $Q(0)$ exists at time 0 and there is some
      constant arrival rate $A(t)=\lambda$.  The figure on the left
      shows the dissipation of the queue when the arrival rate is less
      than the service rate $\lambda<\mu$.  The figure on the right
      shows the increasing queue cased by the oversaturated conditions
      $\lambda>\mu$.}
    \label{fig:queuing-constant-rates}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
 
In the general case, the arrival rate $\lambda$ is not restricted to constant and we have:
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:gen-arr}
  A(t) = \int\lambda(\tau)d\tau \Rightarrow \lambda(t) = \frac{dA(t)}{dt} 
\end{equation*}
Consider flow conditions following an incident that causes the
capacity (or service rate $\mu(t)$) to fall below the demand (or
arrival rate $\lambda(t)$ ) for a period during which the incident is
identified, verified, and actions are taken to restore capacity to its
pre-incident conditions.  Assume that the demand remains constant
during this period; i.e., $\lambda(t) = \mathrm{constant} = \lambda$.
Prior to the incident, $D(t) \equiv A(t)$.  With the onset of the
incident, the resulting queue $Q(t)$ can be expected to start off
small, rise to a peak (maximum) during the process of clearing (owing
to removal activity at the scene), then gradually subside as capacity
is restored. Note that, at some time during the clearing process, the
rate of growth of the queue will be slowed by actions taken at the
scene to begin to restore capacity. Note also that $Q(t)$ will reach
its maximum precisely when capacity has been restored to a level that
is equal to the demand $\lambda$; assuming that the full capacity of
the section is greater than $\lambda$ (if, not, the queue will be
persistent), clearing of the incident ultimately will permit the queue
to be dissipated. This is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:general-incident-queuing}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/queuing-formation-for-typical-incident}
    \caption{The formation of a queuing for a typical incident}
    \label{fig:general-incident-queuing} 
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Here, the arrival rate is less than the service rate, i.e., $\lambda <
\mu$, until $t_0$ and the queue is essentially zero, i.e., $Q(t)
\equiv 0, 0 \le t \le t_0$. Beyond $t_0$, $\lambda > \mu$ so that the
queue grows until $t_2$---the point at which the rate of service rate
$A(t)$ and demand rate $D(t)$ are equal.  From $t_2$ until $t_3$, the
queue diminishes until $t_3$, when $D(t_3) = A(t_3), t \ge t_3$ as
shown in figure~\ref{fig:arrival-service-and-queuing}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/arrival-service-and-queuing}
    \caption[The relationship between the arrival rate, the service
    rate, and queuing during an incident response]{The relationship
      between the arrival rate ($\mu(t)$), the service rate
      ($\lambda$), and queuing ($Q(t)$) during an incident response.}
    \label{fig:arrival-service-and-queuing}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

From the perspective of TMC operations, the corresponding incident
response would look something like
figure~\ref{fig:tmc-resp-and-queuing}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \inputTikZ{figs/tmc-response-and-queuing}
    \caption{TMC incident response and its relationship to queuing dynamics}
    \label{fig:tmc-resp-and-queuing}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Computing queues caused by incident congestion}
\label{sec:comp-queues}

We now turn to the problem of computing delay as a function of the
critical time points of incident response that can be influenced by
TMC actions.


\subsubsection*{Case of slight oversaturation}

Suppose the time period during which $\lambda > \mu$ is relatively short, i.e., $t_3 - t_0$ is relatively
small. Then, expand $\mu(t)$ as a Taylor series about $t_1$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mu-expansion}
  \mu(t) = \mu(t_1)+\frac{d\mu}{dt}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} \cdot{}(t-t_1)
  +\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} \cdot{}(t-t_1)^2
  +O(t-t_1)^3
\end{equation}
But, $\frac{d\mu}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \label{eq:mu-expansion-simpl}
  \mu(t) & = \mu(t_1)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1}\cdot(t-t_1)^2+O(t-t_1)^3 \\
  ~& = \mu(t_1)+\beta (t-t_1)^2 + O(t-t_1)^3, t_0 \le t \le t_3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:beta}
  \beta = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} \: (\mathrm{Note:}\: \beta > 0).
\end{equation}
Observe, at $t=t_0$, (\ref{eq:mu-expansion-simpl}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mu-at-t0}
  \mu(t_0) = \mu(t_1) + \beta \cdot (t_0-t_1)^2+O(t_0-t_1)^3
\end{equation}
Also, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-at-t0}
\begin{split}
  \lambda & = \lambda(t_0) = \mu(t_0) \Rightarrow \\
  \lambda & = \mu(t_0) = \mu(t_1) + \beta \cdot
  (t_0-t_1)^2+O(t_0-t_1)^3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Similarly
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-at-t2}
  \lambda = \lambda(t_2) = \mu(t_2) = \mu(t_1) + \beta \cdot (t_2-t_1)^2+O(t_2-t_1)^3
\end{equation}
Solving (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t0}) for $t_0$ and (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t2})
for $t_2$, neglecting terms $O(t_2 - t_1)^3$ and $O(t_0 - t_1 )^3$ we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t1-t2-implications}
  \begin{split}
    (t_0-t_2)^2 = \frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta} \Rightarrow t_0-t_1 & = \pm\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    t_1>t_0 \Rightarrow t_0 & = t_1 - \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    (t_2-t_1)^2 = \frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta} \Rightarrow t_2 - t_1 & = \pm\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    t_2>t_1 \Rightarrow t_2 & = t_1  + \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Observe from (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t0}) and (\ref{eq:lambda-at-t2}),
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mu-lambda-roots}
  (\lambda - \mu(t))\rvert_{t=t_0} = (\lambda - \mu(t))\rvert_{t=t_2} = 0
\end{equation}
And, from (\ref{eq:mu-expansion-simpl}) we see that $\mu(t)$ is a quadratic in $t$,
so that $\lambda-\mu(t)$ is also a quadratic in $t$ (since $\lambda$
is a constant).  From (\ref{eq:mu-lambda-roots}), $\lambda - \mu(t)$ has
roots $t=t_0,t_2$.  So, $\lambda - \mu(t)$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-mu-form}
  \lambda-\mu(t) = c(t-t_0)(t-t_2)
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:beta})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:d2mudt}
  \beta = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1}
  \Rightarrow \frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1} = 2\beta
\end{equation}
Taking ${d^2}/{dt^2}$ of (\ref{eq:lambda-mu-form}) and comparing
to (\ref{eq:d2mudt}), we get
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2} = 2c \:\Rightarrow\:
  \frac{d^2\mu}{dt^2}\Biggr\rvert_{t=t_1}=2c \:\Rightarrow\: c = \beta
\end{equation*}
So
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lambda-mu-beta}
  \lambda - \mu(t) = \beta(t-t_0)(t-t_2)
\end{equation}
Recall that the queue at any time $t_0 \le t \le t_3$  is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-def}
  Q(t)=A(t)-D(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\left[\lambda(\tau)-\mu(\tau)\right]d\tau
\end{equation}
For the case of a constant arrival rate, $\lambda$, (\ref{eq:qt-def})
becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-def-2}
  Q(t)=A(t)-D(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\left[\lambda-\mu(\tau)\right]d\tau
\end{equation}
Or, from (\ref{eq:lambda-mu-beta})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-def-beta}
  Q(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\left[\beta(\tau-t_0)(\tau-t_2)\right]d\tau
\end{equation}
Integrate (\ref{eq:qt-def-beta}) by parts:
\begin{align*}
  u & = (\tau-t_2) & dv & = (\tau-t_0)d\tau\\
  du & = d\tau & v & = \frac{1}{2}(\tau - t_0)^2
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-final}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t) & =\int_{t_0}^t\left[\beta(\tau-t_0)(\tau-t_2)\right]d\tau
    = \beta\left\{\frac{(\tau-t_2)(\tau-t_0)^2}{2}\Biggr\rvert_{t_0}^{t}
      - \frac{1}{2}\int_{t_0}^t(\tau-t_0)^2d\tau\right\}\\
    &= \beta\left\{\frac{(\tau-t_2)(\tau-t_0)^2}{2}\Biggr\rvert_{t_0}^{t}
      - \frac{1}{6}(\tau-t_0)^3\Biggr\rvert_{t_0}^{\tau}\right\}\\ 
    &= \beta\left\{\frac{(t-t_2)(t-t_0)^2}{2}
      - \frac{1}{6}(t-t_0)^3\right\}\\ 
    &= \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{(t-t_2)}{2}
      - \frac{(t-t_0)}{6}\right\}\\ 
    &= \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{(t-t_0)}{3}
      - \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2}\right\}\\ 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Asymptotic behavior}~\\

For \emph{$\lim_{t\to t_0+} Q(t)$}, we have:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-asymp-at-t0}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t) = \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{(t-t_0)}{3}
      - \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2}\right\}\\ 
    \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2} \gg \frac{(t-t_0)}{3} 
    \Rightarrow Q(t) \approx \beta(t-t_0)^2(t_2-t_0)/2
  \end{split}
\end{equation}


\vspace{1em}\noindent\emph{$\lim_{t\to t_0+} Q(t)$:}
At $t=t_2$, $Q(t)$ reaches its maximum:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:max-qt}
  Q(t_2) =\frac{\beta}{6}(t_2-t_0)^3
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:t1-t2-implications}), i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    t_0 & = t_1 - \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\
    t_2 & = t_1  + \left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Then,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:combined-t0-t2}
  (t_2-t_0) = 2\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
So,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:q-t2}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t_2)& = \frac{4}{3}\beta\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}\\
    & = \frac{4\left[\lambda-\mu(t_1)\right]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}}{4\beta^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}} \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Or,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-prop-oversat}
  Q(t_2) \propto [\mathrm{Oversaturation}]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}
\end{equation}
Note that $Q(t)$ vanishes at $t=t_3$, i.e., $Q(t_3)=0$.  Then, from~(\ref{eq:qt-final})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t_3) =\beta(t_3-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{t_2-t_0}{2}-\frac{t_3-t_0}{3}\right\} & = 0 \Rightarrow  \\
    \frac{t_2-t_0}{2}-\frac{t_3-t_0}{3} = 0 \\
    t_3 = t_0 + \frac{3}{2}(t_2-t_0)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:t1-t2-implications})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t2-ito-t1-t0}
  t_0 + t_2 = 2t_1 \Rightarrow t_2 = 2t_1 - t_0
\end{equation}
Substituting (\ref{eq:t2-ito-t1-t0}) into (\ref{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2}), we
get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t3-ito-t1-t0}
  t_3 = t_0 + 3(t_1-t_0)
\end{equation}
Consider
\begin{equation*}
  Q(t) = \beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{t_2-t_0}{2}-\frac{t-t_0}{3}\right\}
\end{equation*}
But, from (\ref{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t-relate}
  \frac{(t_2-t_0)}{2} = \frac{(t_3-t_0)}{3}
\end{equation}
Substituting (\ref{eq:t-relate}) into the expression for $Q(t)$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qt-ito-t3-t0}
  \begin{split}
    Q(t)&=\beta(t-t_0)^2\left\{\frac{t_3-t_0}{3}-\frac{t_3-t_0}{3}\right\}\\
    &=\beta(t-t_0)^2(t_3-t)/3
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Relative size of queue}
\label{sec:rel-size-queue}

Define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qhat-def}
  \hat{Q}(t) = \frac{Q(t)}{\max\limits_t Q(t)} = \frac{Q(t)}{Q(t_2)}
\end{equation}
Let
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t-hat-def}
  \hat{t}=\frac{(t-t_0)}{t_3-t_0}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qhat-final}
  \begin{split}
  \hat{Q} & =\frac{\beta(t-t_0)^2(t_3-t)/3}{\beta(t_2-t_0)^3/6}\\
  &= 2\frac{\hat{t}^2(t_3-t_0)^2(t_3-t)}{(t_2-t_0)^3}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Total delay}
\label{sec:total-delay}

Observe that the total delay, $D_{\mathrm total}$, is simply
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-def}
  D_{\mathrm total} = \int\limits_{t_0}^{t_3}Q(\tau)d\tau
\end{equation}
From (\ref{eq:qt-ito-t3-t0})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-q3-q0-sub}
  D_{\mathrm total} = \frac{\beta}{3}\int\limits_{t_0}^{t_3}(\tau-t_0)(t_3-\tau)d\tau
\end{equation}
Let $\eta = (t-t_0) \Rightarrow d\eta = d\tau$.  Then (\ref{eq:dtot-q3-q0-sub}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-ito-eta}
  D_{\mathrm total} = \frac{\beta}{3}\int\limits_{0}^{t_3-t_0}\eta^2(t_3-t_0-\eta)d\eta
\end{equation}
Let $\phi = \eta/(t_3-t_0) \Rightarrow d\phi = d\eta/(t_3-t_0)$.
Then~(\ref{eq:dtot-ito-eta}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-ito-phi}
  \begin{split}
    D_{\mathrm total} & = \frac{\beta}{3}(t_3-t_0)^4\int\limits_{0}^{1}\phi^2(1-\phi)d\phi \\
    & = \frac{\beta}{3}(t_3-t_0)^4\left(\frac{\phi^3}{3}-\frac{\phi^4}{4}\right)\Biggr\rvert_{0}^{1} \\
  & = \frac{\beta}{3}(t_3-t_0)^4\left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}\right) \\
  & = \frac{\beta}{36}(t_3-t_0)^4
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
But from (\ref{eq:t3-ito-t0-t2}) and (\ref{eq:combined-t0-t2})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:t3-t0-def}
  t_3-t_0=3(t_2-t_0)/2 = 3\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
So, substituting (\ref{eq:t3-t0-def}) into~(\ref{eq:dtot-ito-phi}), we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dtot-ito-beta-t1}
  \begin{split}
    D_{\mathrm total} &= \frac{\beta}{36}(81)\left[\frac{\lambda-\mu(t_1)}{\beta}\right]\\
    &= \frac{9[\lambda-\mu(t_1)]^2}{4\beta}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
So, total delay is proportional to the square of the amount of
oversaturation, $[\lambda-\mu(t1)]$, \textbf{or} to the 4\textsuperscript{th} power of the peak, $(t_3-t_0)$; i.e.,
\begin{subequations}
  \label{dtot-final}
  \begin{align}
    D_{\mathrm total} & \propto [\lambda-\mu(t_1)]^2 \label{eq:dtot-ito-oversat}\\
    D_{\mathrm total} & \propto (t_3-t_0)^4 \label{eq:dtot-ito-peak}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Estimating tangible TMC benefits}
\label{sec:est-benefits}

Equations (\ref{dtot-final}) offer a tool for estimating TMC benefits
from measurable events in the TMC activity logs.  Specifically, if we
can determine from TMC logs how much the time to initial response to
an incident $t_1$ is shortened by TMC actions, we can estimate the
delay savings attributable to TMC functions.  Furthermore, if these
actions can be associated with specific processes or technologies, we
can make statements regarding the delay savings attributable to
specific TMC assets (or bundles of them). The extent to which this is
possible depends on the quality of data in the TMC logs, which has
been a motivating factor behind the planned improvements to the TMC
activity logs discussed in chapter~\ref{chap:tmc-activity}.


\subsection{Ongoing work}
\label{sec:ongoing-work-tmc-impact}

To date, the incident impact model has not been applied to data.  The
next step in developing this model is to compare baseline delay
predictions of the theoretical model (equations~\ref{dtot-final}) to
the observed delay estimates obtained from the incident impact model
(section~\ref{sec:incident-impact-model}).  The features of the
incident impact model will be determined, in large part, by the
improvements to the activity logging system, but we will also make an
effort to infer the critical points during past incident management
using the legacy logs.



\chapter{System architecture}
\label{sec:system-architecture}


In this chapter we detail how the TMC incident performance evaluation
system will be made available for use in regular TMC operations using
a flexible service-oriented architecture that is under active
development in the Testbed.

\section{Use Cases}
\label{sec:use-cases}


The TMC performance evaluation system could potentially be used in a
variety of settings. The primary use-case is to allow TMC personnel to
perform post-analysis of incidents that have occurred in order to
produce a measure of the value of TMCs to Caltrans and the State of
California. In this role, the system must operate as an easy-to-use
reporting system with which the analyst can specify a set of
analytical parameters defining the incidents to analyze, any necessary
modeling assumptions, and TMC components to model. The ideal interface
will be accessible from any authenticated computer and will use
technology already familiar to operators.

A second potential use-case for the evaluation system is a real-time
mode that attempts to forecast the cost of delaying action on current
incidents. While this use would not be part of this initial project,
it would be a potentially straightforward extension of the core models
to provide real-time decision support to TMC personnel actively
engaged in managing multiple simultaneous incidents. In this role, the
evaluation system would operate in the background, occasionally
broadcasting estimates to other software components for them to
integrate into existing TMC processes.

A third use-case is that the performance evaluation system might be
integrated into existing or future software systems used by Caltrans
and its partners. One obvious example includes the PeMS system, which
performs similar functions with less detail. This project is a natural
extension to that existing work and may therefore be a candidate for
integration.

This software is intended to support a process or set of processes
carried out by TMC operators and traffic engineers.  Toward that end,
the system should integrate as cleanly as possible with existing
processes and the software used to support them.  We note, however,
that existing systems in the Caltrans D12 TMC tend to be monolithic
(and generally proprietary) applications---particularly as regards
their user interfaces.  This makes integrating new software into the
TMC very challenging and potentially expensive.

To overcome these barriers, TMC Incident Performance Evaluation system
is being deployed using horizontal integration strategies that
separate core logic and data from the user interfaces used to interact
with them.  The system architecture is shared by the Cartesius/CTNET
integration project which focuses on the sharing of high-level
incident response information between traffic management centers.  The
initial interface to the system will focus on the post-analysis
use-case and will be web-browser based since that is a platform that
will be familiar to virtually all users.  Integration of the system
into any real-time operations will require further study.
Nonetheless, the architecture of the system should be flexible enough
to allow such deployment in the future.

\section{Service-Oriented Architecture}
\label{sec:soa}

The TMC performance evaluation system is being implemented using a
service-oriented architecture (SOA) as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:system-arch}. A collection of existing databases
provide raw data to the Incident Impact Model.  An analysis scheduler
is configured to regularly execute performance analysis of incidents
to generate baseline delays estimates.  Analysts can use the TMC
impact model via a web interface to analyze the benefits of the TMC
for any identified incident.

A possible future extension of the system for real-time delay
estimation is not shown in the figure. In this mode, a Real-time Delay
Estimator component would actively monitor the system for identified
incidents, and would query the incident impact model to estimate the
relative costs of delaying action on all active incidents. These
results could be broadcast to any TMC management application to assist
operators in prioritizing TMC actions.

\section{Components}
\label{sec:components}

The main components of the performance evaluation system fall into two
categories: logical components that process data to produce new
metrics for use in the TMC and interface components that expose that
data to other software or to users in the TMC.

\subsection{Business Logic}
\label{sec:logic}

\subsubsection{Incident impact service}

The component encapsulates the incident impact model described in
section~\ref{sec:incident-impact-model}.  This component only requires
the user to provide the activity log ID as input.  The service will
independently query the sensor database and CHP CAD data to obtain
further data necessary for the analysis.  The service returns a list
of impacted sections and associated delay calculations.

\paragraph{STATUS:} The core models for the incident impact service
have been developed using perl scripts to generate mathematical
programming formulations for the GAMS general purpose solver.  As the
system is refined, we anticipate building a custom solver that will
perform the delay calculations more efficiently.  We have also engaged
data mining experts to develop improved statistical techniques for
providing congestion evidence for the delay calculation in
section~\ref{sec:delay-calc}.


\subsubsection{TMC impact service}
The TMC impact service will encapsulate the final TMC impact model
resulting from the work described in
section~\ref{sec:mod-tmc-impacts}.  This service requires as input the
activity log ID of the incident to be analyzed, the output from the
incident impact service in order to characterize the critical section
and estimate the arrival pattern to the impacted region, and any
parameters characterizing changes to the observed incident response As
with the incident impact service, this model will independently access
additional databases as necessary to support its analysis.  The
service returns an estimated delay savings attributable to actions
characterized by the input parameters.

\paragraph{STATUS:} The TMC impact service portion of the website will
be developed once the TMC impact model is completed.



\subsection{Interfaces}
\label{sec:interfaces}

The core logic generates data objects that can be adapted for the
use-cases described in section~\ref{sec:use-cases}.  To support these
applications, the architecture includes two main interfaces to the
core logical services.

\subsubsection{Web-based incident post-analysis tool}

The primary interface to the performance evaluation system will be a
straightforward web interface that allows an analyst to query the
model for
\begin{itemize}
\item TMC benefits (delay savings) for specific incidents
\item TMC benefits for a set of incidents meeting particular criteria
  (location, time of day, severity, etc.)
\end{itemize}
The interface will give the analyst control of all input parameters to
the model including necessary assumptions, but will offer sensible
defaults where possible.

\paragraph{STATUS:} We are currently prototyping the web-based
interface using the grails framework, which is an open-source
java-based web application system that is compatible with existing
projects on the Testbed.  Within that framework, we are implementing a
map-based interface using the OpenLayers javascript library and the
openstreetmap map dataset (google maps can also be used as a
background layer).  

Analysis of a particular incident will be reflected in the analysis of
all potentially impacted facilities, whose estimated time-space
impacts will be displayed using a custom javascript widget developed
for this project.
Figures~\ref{fig:view-stddev}--~\ref{fig:view-overlays} show a
preliminary version of this interface.

    overlays.}
  \label{fig:view-overlays}
\end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Incident status event channel}

% To support other use-cases involving integration of the incident delay
% model into TMC operations or other external services, we will provide
% an event channel and associated external interface (using, e.g., SOAP
% or other web-based data feed technology) over which estimates from the
% core delay model will be broadcast to any subscribers.  These
% estimates, for instance, might be integrated into TMC processes (and
% associated software) in order to prioritize incident response being
% managed by the TMC.

% \paragraph{STATUS:} No work has been completed on the status event channel.

\section{Ongoing work}
\label{sec:ongoing-work}


\subsection{Improved TMC activity data}
\label{sec:improved-activity-data}

The first interim report for this project
\citep{rindt08:_measur_based_system_for_tmc_perfor_evaluat}
we noted that
\begin{quote}
  The D12 TMC activity log records sufficient TMC activity to perform
  the basic delay calculation and evaluate a limited portion of the
  benefits provided by the TMC. For the activity log to be more
  generally useful to performance evaluation, entries in the log
  should be tied both to specific technologies that offer notable
  impacts on TMC processes or to procedures that are designed to have
  intended effects.
\end{quote}
These recommendations were folded into a set of modifications being
made to the D12 TMC activity log under the Testbed contract between
Caltrans D12 and UCI.  

\paragraph{STATUS:} We anticipate that the modified TMC Activity Log
will be available by the end of Q3 2008/2009.  At that point, work
will be necessary to make the Activity Log database available to the
TMC performance evaluation system by exposing it (or a shadowed
version of the data) on the SOA so that it can be accessed by the core
modeling components.


\subsection{System architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

The system architecture described above is designed to leverage
existing software under development for related research being carried
out in the Testbed.  The tasks necessary to deploy the TMC Performance
Evaluation platform using this architecture are confined to the
specification of the data sources, business logic (software
implementing the models described in chapter~\ref{sec:method}), user
interfaces, and information flows between those components.
