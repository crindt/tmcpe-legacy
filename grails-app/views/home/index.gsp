		  The TMCPE website is an analysis tool that allows
		  users to estimate the benefit provided by Caltrans
		  Traffic Management Centers by estimating the actual
		  delay caused by managed events using Caltrans loop
		  detector data and modeling the delays that would have
		  occured had TMC mitigation efforts not occured.

			  <h3>What benefits can be estimated?</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
			  The TMCPE method uses as its primary performance
			  measure the delay associated with events that either
			  disrupt the capacity of the system (e.g., accidents,
			  construction, etc) or alter the demand placed on
			  particular facilities (e.g., a baseball game).  In
			  order to estimate the TMC benefits, we have to map the
			  actions of TMC personnel onto the inputs of the delay
			  estimation model that defines the performance
			  measures---in this case, the extent and degree of
			  congestion caused by the event under consideration.
			</p>

			</header>
			<p>
			  Caltrans has a significant investment in TMCs throughout the
			  state. These operations centers are tasked with maintaining
			  the safety and efficiency of California's highways by actively
			  managing disruptions to the system caused by anticipated and
			  unanticipated events that impact the available capacity and/or
			  the demand to use individual facilities.
			</p>
			<p>To date, however, no comprehensive methods are
			available to quantify the benefits of existing TMC
			deployments.  This ongoing research project is
			developing a TMC performance evaluation system that
			addresses this problem. The system allows TMC managers
			to evaluate the performance of various bundles of TMC
			technologies and operational policies by mapping their
			effects onto events in the system that can be measured
			using existing surveillance systems and daily activity
			logs. The resulting tool provides managers with the
			long needed capabilities to:
			</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>justify valuable technology, personnel allocations,
			  and maintenance costs,</li>
			  <li>identify technologies that arenâ€™t meeting their
			  initial promise, and</li>
			  <li>identify gaps in current operational strategies that
			  might be filled with new technology deployments.</li>
			</ul>

			The evaluation method used primarily considers delay
			savings that are attributable to specific TMC actions.  All
			computations are based on direct measurement of the system
			using available sensors and do not rely on speculative
			simulation models requiring extensive assumptions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The system is implemented using a modular software
			architecture that can interface with a variety of
			existing or planned systems used by Caltrans. The
			initial deployment focuses on delivering a reporting
			system accessible from the Testbed Website. Possible
			future deployments could be integrated the core
			performance evaluation models with real-time TMC
			management systems to assist operators with
			prioritizing response.

			<p>The TMC Activity Log Data is preprocessed to identify

			management as defined in
			the <a href="http://localhost/redmine/projects/tmcpe/wiki/Event_Management_Flowchart"

			actions ranging from dispatching traffic management
			team to displaying CMS messages, TMC monitoring, and

			  <h3>Computing Measured Incident Delay.</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
			  The delay calculation estimates the
			  time-space region affected by the incident by using
			  sensor data evidence and assumptions regarding the
			  physical characteristics of traffic flow.  This
			  evidence is formulated into an Integer Program that
			  seeks to identify the time-space region "impacted" by
			  the event such that the degree to which the evidence
			  of congestion as shown in the following image

			<p>
			  which shows how the speed during this incident
			  deviated from the average (green = close to mean or
			  faster, red=far below the mean speed).  The blue
			  border shows the affected region estimated by the
			  TMCPE delay algorithm.

			  <h3>Compute TMC Benefits.</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
			  The "impacted" time-space region identified in step 3
			  serves as the basis for determining the benefits
			  provided by the TMC.  Using this "control volume" as a
			  starting point, we model the lack of TMC
			  actions---such as incident verification via CCTV
			  cameras---as a change in the shape (typically an
			  increase) of the impacted region which defines
			  additional delay.  The difference between the observed
			  delays and those estimated in the absence of the TMC
			  is interpreted as delay savings attributable to TMC
			  actions.  <span class="emph">This feature is not yet
