	  <p>
	    The TMC Performance Evaluation project is designed to offer measures
	    of effectiveness for Caltrans Traffic Management centers by
	    analyzing the delay impacts of accidents, maintenance activities,
	    construction activities, and special events.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The analyses compute delays for incidents using an optimization
	    algorithm to bound the range of incident-induced delay and infer
	    savings attributable to TMC activity by projecting the likely
	    impacts of the same events if TMC management actions weren't taken.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The chart to the right offers a summary of the analyses.  Clicking
	    on the bars will open a new window providing the details of the
	    associated group of incidents.
