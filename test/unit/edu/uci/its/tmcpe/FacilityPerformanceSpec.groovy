/**
 * Specification for FacilityPerformance
 *
 * A FacilityPerformance encapsulates the characterization of how a stretch of
 * freeway performs over some given time period.  The characterization can be
 * from a direct measurement or from some arbitrary model.  
 *
 * For now, this characterization is strictly based upon delay and net delay
 * (delay versus "normal" conditions)
